I am frustrated with how difficult things are. I didn’t take the time to learn German before I moved here. I can understand a few words and speak far less. Don’t get me wrong… I can get around easily in the city as a tourist. I feel like I’ve mastered the public transit, can order food easily, and understand the layout of the city fairly well already. I’ve had a lot of practice being a tourist. But it seems like I can barely dip my toes into what it means to <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">live</strong> in another country.</p><p name="3de8" id="3de8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I get frustrated with the expectations others have for me. I feel as if both people from Germany and the US expect so much of me during my move. I feel as if people don’t expect me to complain so much, or miss home, or run into things daily that make me want to go back to bed, pull the covers up, and go to sleep until the next day. There’s so much stress. There’s so much conflict. There’s so much back-and-forth within me. I am changing because I am in another country. My communication with others is different. My attitude toward others is different. My philosophy on life and emotion is changing faster than it has before. I feel like I have been buried in a mountain of anxiety and I haven’t been inside my comfort zone in a month. The dangerous place that lies outside of my home is terrifying. I am constantly on the lookout for something that might spell the end of my time in Germany, or the end of the electricity in my apartment, or the end of my health without a proper doctor.</p><p name="7a91" id="7a91" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I’ve told myself many times over the past week that Germany is hard because people don’t speak English when you make it outside of the tourist bubble. That’s true. It’s hard. But I have learned to be grateful in spite of this.</p><p name="cf8a" id="cf8a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I am grateful because my life in Germany is simple. I am grateful because my leasing agent for my apartment speaks some English. I am grateful because the employees at IKEA speak English. I am grateful because the employees at Deutsche Telekom speak English. I am grateful because I have a job where everybody is required to speak English. I am grateful because I was given a large sum of money to move to a place that I picked out of a list. I am grateful because I have a support system back in my native country that would be willing to step in and sacrifice anything to make sure I am safe.</p><p name="c995" id="c995" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Sure, my agent brought me to the wrong apartment viewing, and I ended up signing a contract for an apartment I had never seen before. Sure, my mattress from IKEA wasn’t delivered until the day <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">after</em> I moved in. Sure, I wasn’t able to sign up for a phone contract because my visa isn’t for more than two years. Sure, my building’s mailman yelled at me and treated me like a fool because “I don’t understand German but I live in Germany”. Sure, a random repairman came to my apartment as I was showering this morning to tinker with something on my water heater. All of that is minor.</p><p name="300b" id="300b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I can only imagine what it would be like to flee your country, or dream of a better life, and move to the United States only to find that your language is not spoken by the landlords. Or that you have to find your own health insurance without a job. Or that somebody yells at you for “not understanding English even though you live in the United States”.</p><p name="d300" id="d300" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I am privileged. I willfully chose to live in a country whose language I <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">could not speak</strong> just because I thought it would be fun. I can move back to the United States at any time. I didn’t do it because I was forced to leave because of civil war. I didn’t do it because my neighborhood had become too dangerous and too flooded with gang activity. I didn’t do it because my children were starving. I did it as an extension of tourism. I did it for fun.</p><p name="88ba" id="88ba" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I can complain and that is not bad. My life truly is stressful right now. But I can’t imagine being treated like an imbecile in every situation because I don’t speak the language of the country. Thank God that I can talk to people at restaurants. Thank God that I can talk to some people at grocery stores. Thank God for Google Translate.</p><p name="5a3d" id="5a3d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Without language, I have no intelligence here. The mailman did not treat me with respect because he had no way of communicating with me. I felt disrespected and furious with the way my landlord counted the floors in my apartment to try and explain that, yes, I was on the 3rd floor of the building, and yes, this is the apartment I signed the lease for. I couldn’t show them who I truly am. I had my identity ripped away from me. To them, I was some dumb stranger. To them, I was a child.</p><p name="9d40" id="9d40" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I see imaginary faces of the people that have had their identity and their dignity taken away from them because of their inability to speak English, even when they live in the US. I see that they are just as intelligent and capable and understanding as I could ever be. But just because they grew up with another native tongue means that others speak to them as if they were a baby.</p><p name="92ec" id="92ec" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Please show immigrants some mercy. Please don’t build a wall between yourselves and them because you can’t understand them. Please don’t force them to speak your language. Please don’t get angry when they don’t understand. If you find yourselves getting angry at an invisible mob of people crowding and pushing themselves into “your” country… remember that I am one of those people. I am one of those people foolish enough to enter into another person’s world with no prior knowledge of how it works. I am an immigrant.</p></div></div></section>
