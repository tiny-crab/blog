I haven't yet ported all my blog posts into this new format. My energy is petering out today, but I'll get back to these... someday.

* [Substack](https://substack.com/@hypercrab/posts), 3 remaining
* [Medium](https://medium.com/@zakjcrabtree), from a very long time ago, 13 remaining, if I'm feeling particularly archive
* [IHDOTU](https://zachcrabtree.notion.site/In-Depth-Inevitable-Heat-Death-Of-The-Universe-c1fd048f7941404895f3edd8c105bfa1?pvs=73)
* [FFSTrainGame](https://zachcrabtree.notion.site/In-Depth-FFSTrainGame-8dee54e731f14243aaa5bdd70d8e58bf?pvs=73)
* [Transit Simulator Demos](https://zachcrabtree.notion.site/Demos-Transit-Simulator-200c28a1fa644296af0af2729e63a06f?pvs=73)

That's not actually that many!
