Miss? Is everything alright?” I asked, adjusting my glasses and pushing them farther up my nose. She just stared at me, her mouth opening and closing like a fish. I picked up my basket and lightly padded over to another line. I got a similar response. The man stared, before lifting a phone to his face. When he spoke, the store intercom repeated him.</p><p name="c325" id="c325" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“We have an . . . um, elephant, at line 4. Could I, uh, get some help please?” He sputtered before dropping the phone. I didn’t know what to say. This was disrespectful and rude.</p><p name="5853" id="5853" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“My name is Jinora. Yes, I am an elephant. I came here to get milk and eggs, not to be stared at. Now let me pay for my groceries and I will leave!” I angrily shook my purse in his face. He recoiled from my trunk, as if it was a boa constrictor waving wildly in the air. I placed my purse in the basket and walked out in a huff. Nobody seemed to understand me at all!</p><p name="db5a" id="db5a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">After squeezing through the door (seriously, they couldn’t make them compatible with all animals, but just humans?), I began walking down the street. Cars switched into the inside lanes in order to avoid my girth. Of course, that kind of thing makes feminine elephants sad. Who enjoys being avoided? I continued to walk as my eyes watered. I knew it would ruin my makeup, but who cares? People avoided me anyway. Or at least I thought so, before I heard the most wonderful voice.</p><p name="f4f7" id="f4f7" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Why are you crying, sad elephant?” I had heard soothing Latino accents before, but nothing like this. It sounded like chocolate being drizzled over a soft and silky human baby. I shifted my gaze upward to see a beautiful tiger, his coat glimmering in the sunlight. I smiled sheepishly, knowing how silly I looked.</p><p name="4ee8" id="4ee8" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Oh, it’s nothing.” I sniffled, and he drew closer to me. He purred in a low tone, and rubbed up against my leg. My whole body tingled.</p><p name="9b14" id="9b14" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“I don’t think it’s nothing, little elephant.”</p><p name="76bb" id="76bb" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“I’m sorry. I’ve just been having a bad day,” I replied to him. He continued to wander around me, glancing at my hindquarters as he walked behind me. I liked his forwardness.</p><p name="5104" id="5104" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“I know just the thing to cheer you up.” He strode in front of me, and I followed him.</p><p name="7c66" id="7c66" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">After a short walk, I found myself at a small, cozy house. It was nestled in with a few other suburban houses, but most seemed empty or quiet. He opened the door for me, and I crouched to crawl inside. The living room was large enough that I could sit down comfortably. For once, I felt like somebody cared for me. I smiled as he narrowed his eyes at me. He looked like he was a naughty tiger.</p><p name="5a22" id="5a22" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p graf--trailing">“I don’t usually do this without knowing my partner’s name, and I need something to say during my . . . more pleasurable moments. What’s your name?” I asked. He leaned closer to my ear, and sank his teeth into my neck. I felt liquid run down my face before the world went black.</p></div></div></section>
