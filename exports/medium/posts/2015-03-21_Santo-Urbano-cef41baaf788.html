He shifted his weight and pulled his shirt more tightly against his chest and shoulders. The bouncer knew he was intimidating, and he reveled in it. The quiet thump of the bass inside the cobbled walls of the club behind him assured his confidence, a statement to his performance as a filter; a second door that opened only to those that were worthy.</p><p name="c86f" id="c86f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The stranger walked closer, and in the dim haze of the street light, Paolo was able to get a better look at him. A white man, wearing an almost <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">too</em> ratty cowboy hat, but it was just trashy enough to hit a level of cool apathy toward fashion. He walked with a brisk stride, his black Italian shoes too dull to be seen easily in this light. Paolo saw him reach a hand into his coat, presumably for a couple of bills to bribe his way in. Paolo thought quickly of how much he was willing to take before letting him in. Nothing below $50, he thought, before the cold metal of a gun seared his forehead like a cattle prod, paralyzing him into complete stillness.</p><p name="aa56" id="aa56" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“What’s your name, kid?” The voice sounded like a Buick driving down a gravel driveway. A moment of stunned silence, and the handgun was pressed even more aggressively against Paolo’s skin. He, a 275 pound man standing at 6 foot 4, whispered his name, barely audible over the pounding of his heart in his ears. A roar of fear crashed on top of him, swallowing his useless bouncer facade whole.</p><p name="ec18" id="ec18" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Alright, Paolo,” The man said, his voice full of smoke. “You’re going to step aside, and let me in. When I come out, I will pay you no less than five thousand dollars. Or whatever that is in <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Macaco</em> money.” His sneer was as sharp as a razor blade. “I’m just here to… no, that’s too cliche. I’m going to be real with you bud, not going to lie to your face here. I showed up with my pal here, the one pointed at your skull, and I’m going to blow my girlfriend’s whole fucking brain out of her fucking head. You ever been cheated on? Huh? I didn’t think so. Let me tell you, I’m not the first one to feel like doing this, and I’m certainly not the first to actually do it either.” With that, the man pushed open the door. The music filled the alleyway before the door swung shut, leaving Paolo to himself and his breathlessness.</p><p name="69dd" id="69dd" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Yep, just a couple more,” said Merle to the bartender, throwing back his head to tip another shot of fire down his throat. Pistol ready to leap out of his holster and into his hand, he stood and cracked his neck and spine. He reached into another pocket deep in the folds of his coat and pulled a single ring out, before slipping it on his middle finger. In the socket where a gem would be, there was only a small hole, the threads inside barely visible, like the rifling of a gun. He fingered through another pocket, before finding the tool he felt best suited this job. His headache was already beginning, and he stared at this fist as he attached the thing to the front of his ring. It was an inch long spike that corkscrewed near the base. Before Merle had cleared his mind, he was already driving the metal into the back of the man trying to mount the girlfriend he longed to take revenge on. As he screamed, his victim did too, Merle now yelling even louder with the uncorking of the bottle of agony and rage inside his chest. The flaming red hair on the bed belonged to the body he used to love, the soul he shared moments with, that Merle couldn&#39;t bring himself to believe even existed anymore. She wailed like a widow. Soon her blood was mixed with the bodily fluids in the sheets, her skull caved in with a shard of steel crafted for profit.</p><p name="b20f" id="b20f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Merle, blank-eyed and goals finished, pulled a wad of Brazilian cash out of his coat, before dipping a corner in the blood of the prostitute and her recent employer. He slapped Paolo’s back as he left, pushing the money into his chest.</p><p name="b991" id="b991" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p graf--trailing">“You should have stopped me.” Paolo stared at the man’s back, blood money soaking into his once-innocent skin.</p></div></div></section>
