I’d like to believe that I can learn <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">anything</em>, as long as I set my mind to it. It may take me ten years to learn how to play an E chord on an acoustic guitar, but I don’t care. I’m sure there is some talented child out there that learned an E chord while his first cells were still mitosis-ing, but I could honestly care no less about what they can or can’t do, <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">especially</em> if it’s something I’m trying to learn.</p><p name="aa98" id="aa98" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I don’t know whether or not the brain actually works this way, and unfortunately I’m sure the research is out there to refute this entire wall of text, but I will still continue to write. Who knows? I probably won’t even publish this draft.</p><p name="b055" id="b055" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I guess I don’t believe in IQ or some sort of numerical statistic attributed to your intelligence. How is your intelligence defined? Is it by the ability to grow? Is it the vast stores of knowledge that makes somebody intelligent? I think an interesting point of <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Good Will Hunting</em> was that Matt Damon’s character, Will, stated that Beethoven or Mozart could look at a piano and <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">know</strong> what to play, just as he was able to look at some “math-y” paper and be able to solve the problem presented. Organic Chem and proofs of mathematical concepts are two extremely different sciences, sooooo I don’t know how that works. Regardless… I’d wager that Beethoven and Mozart were talented due to the fact that their entire family was musical and they had thousands of hours of immersion and education before they were even a teenager, a time where most average people begin to find their talents. Beethoven’s father began to teach him music when he was a toddler, where he performed (probably forced) at the age of seven for the first time. His father touted him as a child genius, understandably so! The 10,000 hour rule (which was introduced by Malcolm Gladwell in <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Outliers</em>) states that it takes 10,000 hours to achieve mastery. That is almost 5 years of full-time work! To think that a child surrounded by musicians would be able to string together 40 hours a week of musical practice from the age of three to eight isn’t all that spectacular. Along with Beethoven, Mozart also came from a very talented family of musicians and performers.</p><p name="cb7b" id="cb7b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Where does Will Hunting’s uncanny intuition for numbers come from? The movie implies that it’s just a prodigious talent of his. I fully accept that people with no practice at all can become masters of a craft in a fraction of time that it takes other people. However, as I did more research on the target of this “based loosely on a true-ish story” documentary, I found that William Sidis was the true culprit behind Matt Damon’s inspiration for a highly-rated film.</p><p name="234e" id="234e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">William Sidis was born in 1898 to a pair of Jewish Ukrainian immigrants. Although my Wikipedia fracking didn’t turn up much about the economic status of the family, I think my point is further backed by the fact that William Sidis’ father, Boris, received four degrees from Harvard for different sects of psychology. Hm. Boris was most likely a poor immigrant from Ukraine that assimilated so quickly into the American lifestyle that he achieved the true American Dream instantly, and was able to work so hard that he paid his way through school…right? Although I admit to not digging very deeply, I think that wasn’t the case. I feel like anybody growing up in a high-class and university-educated family would end up being more “intelligent” than the middle-class family with first-generation university students.</p><p name="92c0" id="92c0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">William clearly had outstanding mental capacity and the rarity of that is something to ponder as I criticize this film more. I know that just being born into a rich family that went to Harvard will <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">not</strong> make you a genius. I think it is, however, much more likely that somebody that has the <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">capacity</strong> for genius is realized more easily in a family that has those opportunities. I would be surprised if Will Hunting had a brain like he did without a loving and intelligent family, but it surely doesn’t make it impossible.</p><p name="cd17" id="cd17" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The 8.3 rating on IMDB leads me to believe that the traditional audience of films likes to eat this “underdog” story up. I wonder why such a thing enthralls people the way that it does. I feel as if the movie deserved a high rating, as I thoroughly enjoyed the performance of Robin Williams and some of the intense moments of the movie reminded me of American History X (for reasons still unknown). I was expected Will to get hit by a car or shot at the end. I don’t know whether that would have made it better or worse. Anyway, I need more time to think about the plot, because a part of it makes me feel as if I’ve seen this movie before. Another film quite like it is <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">August Rush, </em>a movie where the triumph of talent over one’s poverty-stricken environment is the main arc of the story (and also stars Robin Williams). This received a high score on IMDB (7.6), close to GWH’s 8.3, but was absolutely ripped apart by the critics on Metacritic with a score of 38, as opposed to GWH’s 70.</p><p name="e4d4" id="e4d4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I think that <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Good Will Hunting </em>did a great job handling the flaws of a prodigy, but I feel as if it’s success was due to the fanaticism behind these stories. Look at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/thnkrtv/videos?sort=p&amp;flow=grid&amp;view=0" data-href="https://www.youtube.com/user/thnkrtv/videos?sort=p&amp;flow=grid&amp;view=0" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">THNKR’s Youtube channel</a>, where the top six videos are of child prodigies, all of which have over 2 million views. The top video currently has attained a whopping 11.6 million views. I’d like to point out a remarkable pattern for these videos. Starting with the first:</p><p name="7e84" id="7e84" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Reshat Mati, 15 year old talented kickboxer who has won countless awards in the US. He is a <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">third generation </strong>boxer, where both his grandfather and father boxed throughout their lifetimes.</p><p name="8848" id="8848" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Kelvin Doe, whiz mechanic and engineer from Sierra Leone. He <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">taught himself</strong> how to put generators, transmitters, and batteries together. (This breaks the pattern but I think it’s worthwhile to notice.)</p><p name="306d" id="306d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Keith O’Dell, an eight year old professional pool player. He is a <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">third generation </strong>pool player, and his parents say that he was “born to play pool.”</p><p name="a3ee" id="a3ee" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Santiago Gonzalez, now sixteen years old, claims to know over a dozen different programming languages. His <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">parents</strong> worked to help him move through school more quickly and worked to get him into a university more quickly.</p><p name="a769" id="a769" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Brooke Raboutou, a fantastic rock climber who is the youngest to ever send a 5.14b. She is a <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">second generation</strong> rock climber from two parents that climbed professionally for many years, and set records in their prime.</p><p name="ba5e" id="ba5e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Tim Doner, a polyglot who can speak 20 languages. He comes from parents who were interested in languages (although only speak three, excluding English), but were <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">able to give him time to nurture and grow his amazing ability to learn languages</strong>.</p><p name="dff0" id="dff0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Now, there is definitely a pattern here. Most likely, people that show extraordinary abilities in one topic oftentimes come from a family that was able to: introduce them to the culture early, cultivate that love of learning, and continue to push them to finish what they started. Kelvin Doe is an awesome exception in my opinion, coming from a poor country and receiving no formal education. His talents would be even more noticeable had he received a more advantageous setting to grow his genius potential.</p><p name="de8a" id="de8a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Thank you for reading my brain vomit. Goodnight.</p></div></div></section>
