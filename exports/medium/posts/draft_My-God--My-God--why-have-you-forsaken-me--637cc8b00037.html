Even still, she was the first one to text me. </p><p name="b93a" id="b93a" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">“Are you still at the school?” s</em>he asked.</p><p name="81ba" id="81ba" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">“I heard gunshots and screaming. Please stay away.” </em>she said.</p><p name="70ef" id="70ef" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">She was in Otto Miller Hall (OMH), where the gunman had entered and opened fire on our fellow students. The only class still in session at that time. I had left school fifteen minutes before, only just getting home when I got her message. Calculus got out at 2:50p, the shooting was at 3:10p. Her lab started at 3:00p. I went to tutoring for calculus in OMH every day after class, but that day I didn’t. Why?</p><p name="7bca" id="7bca" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I remember the waves of emotion that overtook me. Suffocating, choking, squeezing the life out of me. It felt as if I was drowning, trying to suck in air but only getting freezing water inside my lungs. Crying out for help, but my  life force escaping me at every scream, making the pain even more excruciating. Not only that, but I felt a sickening guilt, as if I wasn’t the one that was supposed to be hurting. I felt  obligated to be a rock for those that were <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">truly</strong> hurting. I was actually made of sand, and the shooting was a cyclone. Nothing was left.</p><p name="3296" id="3296" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">I have built myself up again, grain by grain. Life is typically a gentle breeze compared to the cyclone, but the last week has felt like a storm is brewing. I think writing will quell the coming winds, and prepare me for what is coming in both the near and distant futures.</p></div></div></section><section name="533b" class="section section--body"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><h3 name="609e" id="609e" data-align="center" class="graf graf--h3 graf--leading">Self</h3><p name="ec63" id="ec63" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">I’ve infrequently found myself imagining a gunman coming into a classroom during a boring lecture. What would I do? How would I protect myself and my classmates? What would happen after I succeed? I can say with mild confidence that I’m not the only one who has asked these questions.</p><p name="d61f" id="d61f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">What do you <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">really</strong> do when that happens?</p><p name="6bdc" id="6bdc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">There is a portion of me that wants to be recognized, to be special. It is hidden within the many layers of my soul, but speaks loudly without discernible source. After the shooting, it had a lot of words to say and a lot of thoughts to think.</p><p name="ba61" id="ba61" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Am I a bad person because I caught myself fantasizing about saving the day during the shooting?</p><p name="ca11" id="ca11" data-align="center" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">I can’t possibly be the only one who has.</em></p><p name="dff5" id="dff5" data-align="center" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">But what if I am?</em></p><p name="96aa" id="96aa" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">These were questions I asked myself. I still find them bubbling to the surface even while  being pushed down by homework, tests, work, relationships, money, and all the rest. </p><p name="1d86" id="1d86" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I haven’t found an answer yet. </p><p name="99f6" id="99f6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">After these first questions, guilt decides to crash the party. It was the main cause of my sorrow during the weeks following the shooting. </p><p name="a4c9" id="a4c9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Paul lost his life today and I keep thinking about what I would have done if I was there. How I could have saved him. Do I wish that I was there? Just so I have a story to tell?</strong></p><p name="03a9" id="03a9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">I still have a story to tell, although it is a story of weakness, vulnerability, brokenness. It is not a tale of power, like I have longed for. Maybe this is why God gave me this story. It  doesn’t focus on my human strength, but rather my dependency on His omnipotence.</p></div></div></section><section name="0db8" class="section section--body section--last"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><h3 name="ec43" id="ec43" data-align="center" class="graf graf--h3 graf--leading">Solo</h3><p name="d3e8" id="d3e8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">First guilt, then loneliness. </p><p name="9090" id="9090" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I remember the moments after turning on the TV, watching the firetrucks barricade the street to Nickerson, the reporters frantically trying to find new information as to what had happened. </p><p name="dfae" id="dfae" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I sent Amy another text message. I wanted to hear from her if anything else happened. She was stuck inside the physics lab for the time being, only being escorted out a couple hours later. I searched through my contacts, finding all of the SPU students I could. I called them, hoping that they would pick up. Everybody did. Everybody was okay. Physically, at least.</p><p name="f3c4" id="f3c4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I sat down and tried to compose myself. I was safe, my friends were safe, everything would be okay, right? I got a call from a friend named Emma later. The moment after we hung up, I realized nobody had contacted me, except for her and Amy.</p><p name="841b" id="841b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This realization eternally tethers me to the shooting. </p><p name="6e22" id="6e22" class="graf graf--p graf--empty graf-after--p"><br></p><p name="d4fa" id="d4fa" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Writing this has been a struggle. My thoughts feel like a flurry of emotion. I’m trying to cram every possible everything that I’ve felt into this, but it all feels so incapable of expressing myself.</p><p name="973d" id="973d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It’s strange trying to write about something as emotional as I want to. I find myself changing my language, wanting to provide a hook, story, perspective, voice, style, quality content. All for the sake of an audience, to make them enjoy. Do these thoughts make my writing any less sincere? Am I trying to manipulate somebody to pity me?</p><p name="2384" id="2384" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I wanted to write a piece like this last year but a voice in the back of my head kept reminding me: “Why does anybody want to hear what you think?” Hardly anybody does. However, writing does help me stitch some of my old wounds back together after they’ve been opened again this past week.</p><p name="2701" id="2701" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I woke up yesterday morning with a knot tied tightly within my gut. I assumed it was because of the exam I had later today, but as I left the classroom after the test, it hadn’t budged. A blanket of dread has enveloped me, but I think putting my thoughts into the physical world will help me lift this yoke from my neck.</p><p name="3848" id="3848" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"> </p><p name="ca79" id="ca79" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I have been lonely. Not emotionally, not physically. </p><p name="b1f4" id="b1f4" class="graf graf--p graf--empty graf-after--p graf--trailing"><br></p></div></div></section>
