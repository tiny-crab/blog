It was fun, and I had a dog of my own to keep me company. Despite that, I hadn’t truly fallen in love with dogs yet.</p><p name="3305" id="3305" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">A year later, I was walking two of her dogs every weekday, and making a fair amount of money for a high school freshman. With $50 dollars a week in my pocket, I was killing it with the ladies. However, I had no idea about the lucrative business that was dog walking, especially in big cities. I was currently living in <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Poulsbo,+WA+98370/@47.7437735,-122.6438583,13z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x5490224d2c266583:0x3e18de5222d7b049" data-href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Poulsbo,+WA+98370/@47.7437735,-122.6438583,13z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x5490224d2c266583:0x3e18de5222d7b049" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Poulsbo</a>, a small town on the wrong side of the Puget Sound. With a population of a little over 9,000, I didn’t have very many opportunities to walk dogs for my neighbors, and most people who owned dogs were a four-person family, which had at least one stay-at-home parent.</p><p name="7619" id="7619" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">When I moved to Seattle for school, I needed money to pay for the enormous tuition from SPU. I had two years of dog walking experience, so why not make a little business and start advertising? I talked to the managers at several apartment complexes and put some flyers in the lobbies. Now I had to wait.</p><p name="894f" id="894f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It didn’t take too long to get my first client, a chocolate lab puppy named Hoosier. It was then that I finally discovered my love for all canine companions.</p><figure name="0a1f" id="0a1f" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*HuerF3JxCAuSwgAjEFy-Rw.jpeg" data-width="1217" data-height="825" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*HuerF3JxCAuSwgAjEFy-Rw.jpeg"></figure><p name="eccc" id="eccc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">All this backstory, and I’m finally getting to the point. I can’t remember a day when I got frustrated with my job, or dreaded taking the time to let a dog out. Often, the best part of my day is getting to walk dogs. I can spend some time outside, walk around, and have fun with excited furballs, each full of personality and energy.</p><p name="6b77" id="6b77" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I’ve only had a few other jobs, all of which were part-time. I worked as a bagger at a grocery store. My task was to put items into a bag (<em class="markup--em markup--p-em">very</em> difficult work) and hand it to an often-grumpy customer who wouldn’t thank me most of the time. I enjoyed working with the people who were nice, and most of the employees were great, but that job saved me from getting a career in customer service.</p><p name="a1fa" id="a1fa" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Another job that I still currently hold is a Product Specialist for <a href="http://suitabletech.com" data-href="http://suitabletech.com" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Suitable Technologies</a>. My job is to sit in my room and use the Beam software to log into a Beam device at some event across the country. It’s such a novel experience to drive the devices, and people are often in awe of the technology. However, I find that the job can get dull at times, and it can be hard keeping a smile on your face for so many hours in a row.</p><p name="e678" id="e678" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I think that the true magic from dog walking is that <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">the subject of my work lives and breathes and loves me just as much as I love it.</strong> I am willing to pick up its poop with my hands, because I feel as if the dog would do anything for me in return.</p><p name="fc66" id="fc66" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">When bagging groceries, I don’t care about the organic, gluten-free, ultra-low-fat tofu that you bought, just like you don’t care about being snippy to me when you want double bags. When I’m working with people through the Beam Telepresence system, I care about the experience the other person has, but they couldn’t care less about what they say to me. They just want to see the device in action.</p><p name="f5c6" id="f5c6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">I wonder what other careers people might enjoy if there was a relationship like the one between a dog and its master. Is there a way we can translate that relationship into technology, where the user feels loved, and they care for the tool in the same way?</p></div></div></section>
