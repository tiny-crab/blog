I almost fell asleep while drinking afternoon tea with Courtney. I hadn’t eaten well that day and was feeling sick after many hours on planes, trains, and automobiles. I was numb to most of my emotions. I found myself thinking: <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Why isn’t this fun?</em></p><p name="b0a4" id="b0a4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I have been to many different countries. These include: Canada, Mexico, Spain, Morocco, Ethiopia, Egypt, Iraq, Turkey, Japan, Korea, Iceland, Norway, Italy, Greece, France, and Ireland. To think back on each one of these trips makes me happy.</p><p name="fa21" id="fa21" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But my hindsight is not 20/20 when it comes to travel memories. Even the unpleasant, uncomfortable, and scary memories are good. I learned something. I grew. I was forced into the <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">real</strong> world of differing culture, skin tone, language, thought processes, and ways of life. This is what it means to travel.</p><p name="01a0" id="01a0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">These rosy memories are good to recount to others. But they are unhelpful when visiting new countries. I find myself disappointed that my current state isn’t as exciting as the trips that I remember. As I think more intensely about my time in Japan, I remember thinking: <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">I’m getting really frustrated and tired while being here. Is this normal? I just want this trip to be over.</em></p><p name="38b3" id="38b3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Oxford didn’t frustrate me, but it exhausted me. Courtney and I walked everywhere. We stayed in an Airbnb where we felt forced to stay huddled in our tiny bedroom to avoid the family downstairs. I was (and still am) self-conscious of my American looks and American accent and my American mannerisms; trying to hide those was impossible. But still, I tried to hide something that is plainly visible.</p><p name="a311" id="a311" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">After all of that effort to fit in, my body was wound tight. My mind spiraled into self-loathing and self-pity as it is wont to do. My introversion does not cope well with unfamiliar places, people, and sounds. To settle down slightly, we sat in St Mary’s for some time. Soaking in the piety and wisdom and respect that the sanctuary had encouraged for many years made me feel slightly untangled. But I still struggled against the knots in my brain.</p><p name="deaa" id="deaa" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Around the corner, we found an elegant quad of green grass lined with the standard Oxford architectural style. Through the thick pressure of silence imposed on the field, I heard the sound of a cello’s body resonating. My bloodhound instinct for live music drove me forward, tugging Courtney behind me with one arm.</p><p name="8ef4" id="8ef4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I sat down in that chapel feeling the weight of my self-image pressing against my skull from all sides inside and out. I pulled out my journal and described the scene:</p><blockquote name="fb32" id="fb32" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">Sitting now in a chapel where an old man is teaching a young boy to play cello and piano. The way it echoes in this stony-walled sanctuary makes each note sound more resonant and less individual. Instead of being primarily composed of the vibrations of the strings, the music seems to vibrate solely in the air around the piano. I am dying to play that piano, to press in and see how the sound changes. To restrain myself and see how each note fills the room.</blockquote><p name="0178" id="0178" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">I looked up at Courtney with slight tears in my eyes. She smiled at me with a full spectrum of empathy. The first time I cried on the trip was here. It was the first time I was able to relax.</p><figure name="ef74" id="ef74" class="graf graf--figure graf--iframe graf-after--p graf--trailing"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NlN7aaVFQUw?feature=oembed" width="640" height="480" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></figure></div></div></section><section name="ede3" class="section section--body"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><figure name="caed" id="caed" class="graf graf--figure graf--leading"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*hz62tK8kj8kXCNdaJELk5w.jpeg" data-width="3024" data-height="4032" data-is-featured="true" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*hz62tK8kj8kXCNdaJELk5w.jpeg"></figure><h4 name="61f5" id="61f5" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--figure">what happened</h4><p name="de6d" id="de6d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Cobbled stones and elegant churches line the streets of Oxford. The gothic architecture evokes a dark sense of Christianity, one of pain and grittiness. This is the Christianity I like, one that pays attention to suffering and mourns loss. The city grieves the cross and celebrates in it. Oxford feels like a place of intense study. Theology is studied in both the schools and the churches. It is studied from books past and present. My mind is stimulated by intense study, and Oxford felt like a place that I could hone that stimulation.</p><figure name="bdaf" id="bdaf" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*lmkKIx48YgIQSV27rdir7w.jpeg" data-width="4032" data-height="3024" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*lmkKIx48YgIQSV27rdir7w.jpeg"></figure><p name="4b5b" id="4b5b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">The people in Oxford are nice, casual, and helpful people. The stereotypical snobby Brit atmosphere doesn’t seem to be as ubiquitous as one might think. I felt uncomfortable in pubs because I don’t drink, but the bartenders helped me to feel more at ease with their welcoming air. The pedestrians dressed with both classy and flashy styles. Business suits and nice dresses were seen everywhere, but did not overwhelm the number of shorts and crop tops. The intersection between students and middle-aged people was prominent in Oxford because of this.</p><figure name="bdd6" id="bdd6" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*CPqckhVQf_zDprzhzMIp2A.jpeg" data-width="3024" data-height="4032" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*CPqckhVQf_zDprzhzMIp2A.jpeg"></figure><p name="6ea8" id="6ea8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure graf--trailing">Fish and chips were crispy and breaded in just the right way. Potato chips were salt-and-vinegared perfectly. Sausage rolls were flaky and strong and fragrant. Other than that, the food wasn’t spectacular. Because the UK is steeped in tea culture, we found good cups of it everywhere. I enjoyed a new blend of lemongrass and ginger. I hadn’t seen that in Seattle before, but was familiar with the majority of other flavors. I loved the large selection at nearly every cafe and coffee shop! Courtney and I found a fantastic boba tea shop down an intriguingly narrow alleyway. It was authentic Taiwanese boba (according to our server) and was made with real tea as opposed to powder like many stores in the US use. The dedication to quality tea was noticeable in Oxford.</p></div></div></section><section name="94de" class="section section--body section--last"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><h4 name="c49d" id="c49d" class="graf graf--h4 graf--leading">more reflections</h4><p name="fe99" id="fe99" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">This trip has already begun to be quite different than others. In the past, I’ve spent months and months planning trips in advance. I prepared for my trip to Japan in 2014 for almost a year; my trip around Europe in 2015 took several months of planning. Courtney and I purposely planned this trip with only a few destinations in mind. We purchased plane tickets less than two months before we left. I have done hardly any research for each city, which means I have little to be excited for. I am exploring each city almost blind.</p><p name="296e" id="296e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This allows me to walk into each city with exploration as a focus. Interesting buildings on the horizon guide the majority of our walks through the day. However, I can’t work myself up to be excited for things I have only just found, due to my generally stoic nature.</p><p name="3a2b" id="3a2b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Is that bad? I don’t know.</p><p name="05ff" id="05ff" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I’m chasing after excitement and wonder and awe. I will never find it in its fullness. That’s a hard pill to swallow, but I have no choice but to force it down without water. I’m sorry to those who think this might be pessimistic. To me, realizing that life will never meet the expectations that are set by our glossy electronic screens around us is comforting. But it’s only comforting once the pill goes down and the medicine starts to work.</p><p name="6911" id="6911" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Ugh. I find myself wanting to repeat so many other millennials.</p><p name="7ee4" id="7ee4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">What we are promised by our addictive media is all a lie. Life is not a picture. Life is not a 6-second video, a 30-second video, a 58-second video. It is not a movie contained within a couple of hours.</strong></p><p name="0d51" id="0d51" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Stop focusing on the events. Stop focusing on making each day perfect.</strong></p><p name="8a2a" id="8a2a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">This is more of a cry to myself than anybody else. I hope you can hear me sigh from behind this screen, this keyboard, and these pictures. I sigh not because I am unhappy but because I have been lied to. I have been told that if I just try hard enough, if I just work hard and put my mind to it, I can make myself happy. That I can choose to be happy. As if I can find some little jewel of joy to keep within my heart that will warm me throughout my time away from my one true home with family and friends and evergreen trees and the smell of rain. I miss you, Seattle. I miss you, family. I miss you, my friends. With all of my heart. I love missing you and I hate missing you. I wish I could sever all the tethers that connect you and me, so that I could get over it and move to Berlin and fall in love all over again with a city so different and so new. The Berlin in my head is imagined, it is a dream, and it is a nightmare. I know nothing of the real Berlin, I won’t until July 12th and the days that follow. And until then, I am homeless.</p></div></div></section>
