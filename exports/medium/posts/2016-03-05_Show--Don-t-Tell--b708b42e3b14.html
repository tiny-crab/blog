It never seemed as if he had the words ready on his tongue, like so many others. The eloquence and beauty that flowed out of the mouths of others was never matched by him. All he could say were short, brusque, and often dull-sounding words that fell out of his mouth and landed in his listener’s ears with a muffled <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">thunk</em>.</p><p name="82ba" id="82ba" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The frustration did not lie in his inability to speak, but rather his inability to express himself. What better way in this day and age to express your feelings, motives, and desires? People constantly speak to one another; through text messages, email, instant messaging, forums, phone calls, it all seemed to be so simple! Just speak, or write, and your ideas could be instantly emulated inside the audience’s mind. No other unnecessary distractions like body language or facial expressions. Even tone of voice often was misrepresented, and thus created friction. Getting rid of everything else should make conversation so easy. Once language is whittled down to a small stream of symbols, beautiful things can be crafted with minimal effort. But the simplicity of writing never generated any fruitful dialogue between him and others.</p><p name="2de7" id="2de7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This is what the man thought often. <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">How can I express my thoughts in ways other than words?</em> The thought struck him again as he sat at a crowded coffee shop. He sat here often. The tables were made out of segments of logs, not processed and pressed like other woods. The smooth lacquered surface had grown sticky with the customers’ poor handling of their freshly made lattes, cappuccinos, mochas, frappuccinos, doppios.</p><p name="760e" id="760e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">As he sat, he scrolled endlessly through articles on his phone. Unlike others, he wasn’t compulsive about checking his phone. He <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">always</strong> had an agenda when he started browsing the web. He <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">always</strong> looked for words that were quality. He <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">always</strong> practiced his writing through reading. Today was not any different. Or at least, today wasn’t different in the beginning.</p><p name="b627" id="b627" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In the beginning, he sat down in a fairly empty corner of the shop, and gently placed his ceramic cup on the enameled wood table. He took a sip of foam mixed with too-hot coffee. His tastebuds meekly reminded him of the temperature. He set the coffee down again, the bottom of the cup making a sound against the top of the saucer. He looked over at the counter again, where a woman was serving a man, a naked scone being transferred from her hand to his.</p><p name="31b1" id="31b1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Could a scone sound more appetizing than now? The man didn’t even know they had scones at the coffee shop, even though he had been here many many times. He had earned three free drinks through his devoted use of punch cards, which meant that he had ordered more than thirty drinks. But he had never seen the scones at the counter. Maybe they were new.</p><p name="2239" id="2239" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Perhaps it was the scone that broke his habit. It could have been the jolt of burning coffee on his tongue. But after he looked up, he decided to avoid looking at his phone altogether, and observe his surroundings instead. Really, the question of <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">was it the scone or hot coffee?</em> was pointless when the man had finally realized how to truly practice his writing and communication. He merely had to observe the world, and paint the actions of others using words, not colors. His words would get more colorful, yes, but it didn’t matter how many more frivolous words he could recite, they were just dead wood washed up on the beach until he mashed them together into something more beautiful: an uncommon sculpture of too-common resources. Eventually his mashing could turn into something more unique and deliberate, but that would take time. Now all he could focus on was his surroundings.</p><p name="50d6" id="50d6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">These surroundings weren’t particularly inspiring at all, unfortunately. He wasn’t sitting in Paris, watching the smartly dressed humans pass by on the sidewalk. He wasn’t overlooking a gorgeous vista at sunset; the sun was far from the horizon now, not draping the clouds in pink and orange color. Instead, all he had was this boring coffee shop. As he looked closer, it seemed as if this boring setting was one of the most interesting he had seen. All it took was more than a passing glance.</p><p name="ec17" id="ec17" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The aspect of the coffee shop that the man liked best was the large glass windows that composed the front wall. They wrapped around the front door, a small and inconspicuous thing that was painted a meager red. The windows were typically clean, but today they were covered in streaks that were glaringly reflective in the harsh sunlight (perhaps they were dirty everyday, but the man never realized it).</p><p name="bd69" id="bd69" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Bored again, the man turned his attention to the people sitting around him. It was strange how so many people in close contact would find it unthinkable to have a conversation with a stranger here. Almost all patrons of the cafe had something in common, they either liked to read, or browse the internet, or drink coffee, or worked at the nearest boutique down the street.</p><p name="e55c" id="e55c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The woman at the counter seemed impatient, there were no staff at the counter. Little did she know, the man who ordered the scone had also ordered the girl behind the counter to warm it up for him. Apparently the microwave or toaster oven or industrial heater was in the back, and there were no other staff to help this woman who wanted so badly to be helped.</p><p name="0256" id="0256" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Another woman, sitting down, had large gauges in her ears, reminiscent of ancient cultures’ obsession with earlobes. A beanie was perched on her head. It looked asleep. It slouched over the back of her head. Her long, straight, brown hair was bland and uninteresting, yet it seemed as if the woman had spent time making it look that way.</p><p name="0b0f" id="0b0f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">What kind of thoughts did these people think?</p><p name="a9b4" id="a9b4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Were they abrupt? Short? Little jots of emotion, filed and tucked away without a second look?</p><p name="b88a" id="b88a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Were they long, drawn out things that never seem to come to an end, always dragging without pause, moving from subject to subject, topic to topic, without any segmentation between ideas?</p><p name="c336" id="c336" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Without much more to observe, the man chuckled to himself, and took another sip of his coffee.</p><p name="cba9" id="cba9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">(Thanks for reading my little writing exercise, please throw a little green heart my way if you thought it was okay.)</p></div></div></section>
