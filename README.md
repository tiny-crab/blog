## Zach Crabtree

Indie game dev and composer.

## Video Game Development
I have built 2D games in lots of different genres. I'd like to build more strategy and RPG-like games.

My favorite games are:
* Risk of Rain
* Mini Metro
* Hyper Light Drifter
* A Short Hike
* Mario and Luigi: Superstar Saga
* Breath of the Wild
* Baldur's Gate 3

## Music
I generally skew toward mysterious, organic, ambient compositions.

My favorite OSTs are:

* Hyper Light Drifter (disasterpeace)
* Celeste (Lena Raine)
* Hollow Knight (Christopher Larkin)
* Risk of Rain (Chris Christodoulou)
