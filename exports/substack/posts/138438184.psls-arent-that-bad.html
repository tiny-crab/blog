<p>Happy Monday! Last week was a journey, so today I was actually a little happy to get back into the normal work routine at home.

Two giant fish tacos: two breaded fillets each topped with a handful of cabbage and pico, sitting demurely in a soft corn tortilla slathered with crema. A silky dollop of beans paired with steaming Mexican rice sat alongside. A tightly wound sandwich bag holding probably just an eighth of the largest carrot on earth, pickled with some peppers, onions, and oregano. It was an immensely satiating meal - the first I had eaten that day besides a bag of chips on the plane.</p><p>Food and anxiety is a paradox for me. Eating good food is an intensely comforting, nourishing, and embodying experience for me. But when I’m anxious, I get nauseous and the sight of food makes me sick. Even watching other people eat can be too much for me. There was a period of time when I was 12 or 13 where I couldn’t eat in restaurants regularly because I would get anxious about the possibility of getting nauseous when I was trying to eat, which then spiraled until I had to just remove myself from the meal and wait outside in the car until my family was done.</p><p>I’ve been trying to lean on food as a way to comfort and nourish myself when anxious or panicking. It’s not easy since food becomes a source of anxiety when I’m worried about something else (I often can’t eat in the couple of hours before a flight). Fortunately, I got to eat this food with Courtney, and that helped calm me down a bit and stomach it all. The pickled carrots were a good bite to “snap” me out of it, and the tacos were light without being bland. The warm, homey nature of rice and beans also felt like a little hug.</p><h3>It’s the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown</h3><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-imag" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fae852af9-d15b-4a14-96ff-487d17f0e434_1200x872.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fae852af9-d15b-4a14-96ff-487d17f0e434_1200x872.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fae852af9-d15b-4a14-96ff-487d17f0e434_1200x872.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fae852af9-d15b-4a14-96ff-487d17f0e434_1200x872.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fae852af9-d15b-4a14-96ff-487d17f0e434_1200x872.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/ae852af9-d15b-4a14-96ff-487d17f0e434_1200x872.jpeg" width="1200" height="872" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/ae852af9-d15b-4a14-96ff-487d17f0e434_1200x872.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:872,&quot;width&quot;:1200,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:null,&quot;alt&quot;:&quot;It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown' cartoon streams for free this weekend&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:null,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown' cartoon streams for free this weekend" title="It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown' cartoon streams for free this weekend" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fae852af9-d15b-4a14-96ff-487d17f0e434_1200x872.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fae852af9-d15b-4a14-96ff-487d17f0e434_1200x872.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fae852af9-d15b-4a14-96ff-487d17f0e434_1200x872.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fae852af9-d15b-4a14-96ff-487d17f0e434_1200x872.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a></figure></div><p>Courtney and I watch all the Charlie Brown movies for each holiday. I think we unsubscribe and resubscribe to Apple TV four times a year. It’s…. really not worth the effort to save however much $$ we save during the summer months when there aren’t any to watch.</p><p>This was our first time down in San Diego during the Halloween season. We watched this movie on Courtney’s parents giant L-shaped sectional, each in our pajamas. I ate Doritos Flamas (I’m starting to feel like these aren’t worth the stomachache) and enjoyed the holiday mood. </p><p>I’ve never been one for traditions and holiday vibe. At some point in my life, I decided that my general reaction to seasonal activities was an eye roll and a sigh. I’m not totally sure why - but I usually always positioned myself as “this is stupid”. Maybe it’s something I picked up as a teenager. I wonder if it’s some toxic masculinity trait, or a counter-culture / anti-mainstream thing.</p><p>I’ll spare you the self-loathing and stop at: I don’t wanna do that anymore. I want to go to pumpkin patches and dress in fall colors and go see christmas lights and watch every Charlie Brown movie every year. I’ll say it’s a downright boring take nowadays to hate on PSLs. They’re fine. They’re kind of just like a chai latte except with coffee instead of black tea? You can’t hate chai.</p><p>Plus how can anybody not love sitting with their dog and partner on the couch and having a little family tradition together?</p><div

ramen. RAKIRAKI is a bustling, sterile restaurant in a business plaza in Kearny Mesa. Business plazas are usually <em>very</em> hit or miss for me. And personally, I do think my enjoyment of the food comes down to the character of the restaurant. The atmosphere of the place - the first impression - sets me on a path of loving the food or being skeptical. This was my first impression:</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link image2 is-viewable-imag" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2820251e-4e1d-4aa6-aaad-9b732c8e518c_4031x2653.jpeg" data-component-name="Image2ToDOM"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2820251e-4e1d-4aa6-aaad-9b732c8e518c_4031x2653.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2820251e-4e1d-4aa6-aaad-9b732c8e518c_4031x2653.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2820251e-4e1d-4aa6-aaad-9b732c8e518c_4031x2653.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2820251e-4e1d-4aa6-aaad-9b732c8e518c_4031x2653.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/2820251e-4e1d-4aa6-aaad-9b732c8e518c_4031x2653.jpeg" width="1456" height="958" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/2820251e-4e1d-4aa6-aaad-9b732c8e518c_4031x2653.jpeg&quot;,&quot;srcNoWatermark&quot;:null,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:958,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:3511455,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;topImage&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null,&quot;isProcessing&quot;:false}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2820251e-4e1d-4aa6-aaad-9b732c8e518c_4031x2653.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2820251e-4e1d-4aa6-aaad-9b732c8e518c_4031x2653.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2820251e-4e1d-4aa6-aaad-9b732c8e518c_4031x2653.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F2820251e-4e1d-4aa6-aaad-9b732c8e518c_4031x2653.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="20" height="20" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" x2="14" y1="3" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" x2="10" y1="21" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a></figure></div><p>This wasn’t even all the menus. There were FIVE different menus placed at our table. There were three copies of the black menu with all their noodles on it. One copy of the drink menu on the far right. The white menu in the middle? Their vegan options. The menu with the fried chicken and beer on it was their fried chicken menu. What?? Even more confusing was the fact that the vegan, chicken, and noodle menus all seems to have different “titles” on them? As if we were sitting down at a food court and we could order from three different restaurants.</p><p>Anyway, I was downright overwhelmed at the first pass through all of these menus. The five of us had to share one copy of certain menus. All the items on the noodle menu had at least a paragraph of fine text and tons of duplicated information. The only difference between the majority of ramen bowls was what broth you’d get - the toppings were nearly identical and they all had the same options of protein. It was a mess.</p><p>If a sterile restaurant in a business plaza was strike one, this was strike two. Fortunately that’s when the food arrived.</p><p>We all shared some fried chicken to start out. I was happy to try all three of their sauces - if I remember correctly, we had it with a spicy mayo, a reduced and syrupy ponzu dip, and some sort of sweet chili sauce. The chicken was very freshly made! When I bit into it, a jet of steam blew out of my mouth and I might have burnt several hundred of my taste buds. The skin was nice and craggy-crunchy and the interior was perfectly cooked.</p><p>The bowls of ramen came out with a thick wooden steamer lid on top. A little extra, but I liked the “rustic” touch in an otherwise modern place. My miso broth was thick and salty, and balanced perfectly between a silky and viscous mouthfeel. The pork, although charred nicely with a torch, was overcooked and was a little too dry. The noodles were great. They were chewy and snappy, something that I’ve always struggled with my noodles, so I appreciate the craft even more! The marinated egg’s yolk could have been jammier and the flavor a bit punchier. </p><p>Courtney asked me how I liked the food, and I spared her the details while we ate. I don’t typically like to talk about this kind of stuff in the actual place I’m being served lest I’m overheard. I was happy and well-fed, but I definitely had some notes in mind.</p><p>That was until there was a lull in our table’s conversation and I zoned out while watching the chefs prepare food. I admired all the tools of their trade - the perpetual boil of water in a stockpot for noodles, all the prep bins of chopped ingredients, the person torching the chashu pork with one hand while garnishing the bowls with the other. I can’t help but observe my food’s quality, but I also felt a little bad thinking to myself about all the ways it could have been better. As I looked at the well-oiled machine of a kitchen and how each bowl is made, I kind of just… stopped caring about the food just then. I was happy to be full, happy to have eaten a perfectly satisfying meal, and happy to have enjoyed it with family. I also had a canned oolong tea that was just… the perfect refreshing complement to the food. </p><p>Come eat here! </p><p>I just really wish they’d do something about the menus… it’s probably the worst design I’ve ever seen. It’s even worse than the menus at the Cheesecake Factory where there’s fourteen thousand dishes!!! </p><h2>Some simple pleasures</h2><h4>Airplane Bathrooms</h4><p>Yeah. Airplane bathrooms. Such a pleasure to stand up and pee during turbulence. Some 50-60% of people on planes haven’t experienced that!</p><p>No, but really, I want to talk SPECIFICALLY about the bathroom door latch. I think it’s a really satisfying piece of hardware.</p><p>How many interactions do you have with a sliding knob? I can only think of an airplane bathroom door. Shutting the door is already a pretty satisfying interaction; you’ve been in a cramped tube with a bunch of people you probably hate just by being near them… now you’re in a cramped room - but by yourself! The door always closes pretty fast and thuds shut. Heavy things are always more satisfying to interact with than light things.</p><p>Then you get to latch the bathroom door. An extra layer of safety from the mob of buffoons outside (just the passengers, the flight staff are always the best). Slide it shut, hear the sound of the deadbolt clunk into place, and the best part - the light in the bathroom turns on! A masterpiece of interaction. So much feedback just from one simple action.</p><h4>Grocery Shopping at a Mexican / Asian market</h4><p>I grew up going to grocery stores like Albertson’s. Eventually I’ve started to realize that a lot of the things I really like to cook are in Asian markets. And a lot of the things Courtney really likes to cook are in Mexican markets. They’re special places for me, since I’ve only really experienced them as an adult. They almost always feel more personable (less franchisable branding), and have lots of cool things you can’t find elsewhere.</p><p>While in San Diego, we visited one of the best Mexican markets with prepared tamales, aguas frescas, ceviche, all the snacks, and tons of pan dulce and other baked goods. We went with Courtney’s family and just meandered around.</p><p>Like the whole seasonal activity rant above, I’ve typically had a posture of “get in, get out” with grocery stores. I don’t meander. I don’t savor. I don’t enjoy.</p><p>This time, we had more of a reason to. This was a nostalgic trip for a couple of the people with us. With the sheer number of prepared foods that I hadn’t encountered before, I loved scoping out the whole store before deciding what to eat for lunch. I shared two tamales (one hatch chile + queso, one pork) with Courtney on a walk. I wiped the pork grease off my hands on the inside of my shirt. It was a good day.</p><div class="native-video-embed" data-component-name="VideoPlaceholder" data-attrs="{&quot;mediaUploadId&quot;:&quot;5ce25726-45bc-47fc-9519-a9230eb6c29f&quot;,&quot;duration&quot;:null}"></div><h4>Dogs</h4><p>This trip to San Diego was the first I had traveled with Herald by myself. I was a little anxious about flying with him on my own. I didn’t know if he would be on his good behavior (silently staring at me for two and a half hours underneath the seat in front of me) or on his bad behavior (staring at me for two and a half hours while whining).</p><p>I knew that Herald would pick up on my anxiety, so my first order of business was to calm myself, so that I could calm him down if need be. When we’ve flown before with Herald, we put him under the seat immediately upon boarding. This time, I set his tiny carrier on the seat next to me before putting all my things for the flight in the seat pocket. Until we started to taxi onto the runway, I held his carrier on my lap and close to my chest. It was really relaxing I think for both of us, and even after I put him under the seat, he curled up and went to sleep. No sad eyes staring at me the whole flight!</p><h3>A dream I had last night</h3><p>Last night I had another instance of this recurring dream of a gym bathroom. For some reason whenever I end up dreaming about bathrooms they’re all the same format - I’m in a locker room, except there are hundreds of dirty toilets in rows and they’re all exposed to one another. No walls, no curtains, no nothing. There are also no walls between the gender-separated locker rooms. Nobody else needs to use the bathroom except for me, so everybody else thinks I’m weird for needing to use the toilet in this really unpleasant situation. This is a stress dream, if you couldn't tell.</p><p>For some reason, this time there were baby birds everywhere? Specifically baby robins. They were nesting in all the nooks and crannies of the bathroom and let me feed them and pet them. I was taking pictures of them to show Courtney - she and I both really like robins. It’s a special bird to us! I have a tattoo of one on my thigh. I think the dream ended as one baby robin toddled out of a crack in the bathroom, and started to stretch and spread its wings. </p><p>Drop your interpretation of my dream in the comments. What does it mean? </p><div class="subscription-widget-wrap-editor" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://hypercrab.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe&quot;,&quot;language&quot;:&quot;en&quot;}" data-component-name="SubscribeWidgetToDOM"><div class="subscription-widget show-subscribe"><div class="preamble"><p class="cta-caption">don’t forget to smash the like button.
