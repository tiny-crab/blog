I was playing one video game or another when I began to think about the pieces of art that make up a game. I am an avid PC gamer and value story and art direction over the graphics quality or number of guns in-game. I am also a fanatic for good music, writing, and TV. Here is my idea of what makes one better than another.</p></div></div></section><section name="3293" class="section section--body"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><h3 name="a768" id="a768" class="graf graf--h3 graf--leading">Music</h3><figure name="7406" id="7406" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--h3"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*EuwMVHon7vcg2A5G-cQYDw.jpeg" data-width="1024" data-height="455" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*EuwMVHon7vcg2A5G-cQYDw.jpeg"><figcaption class="imageCaption">My face when I bike farther than 50 miles.</figcaption></figure><p name="e38b" id="e38b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">I started playing piano at the tender age of six, learned my way around a drum kit and various other percussion instruments at twelve, and have continued my study of music for six years since then. Over the course of that time, I have listened to countless hours of 80s and 90s metal, while growing my musical opinion into a not-so-bold mix of mellow indie alternative and quiet instrumental (to listen to while writing posts like this). Although I do still enjoy dabbling in electronic, rock, and jazz at times, I find myself listening to artists like <a href="http://www.mreemusic.com/" data-href="http://www.mreemusic.com/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Mree</a>, <a href="http://keatonhenson.com/" data-href="http://keatonhenson.com/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Keaton Henson</a>, and <a href="http://www.halfmoonrun.com/" data-href="http://www.halfmoonrun.com/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Half Moon Run</a> the most.</p><p name="4e37" id="4e37" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I believe that music holds a special place in my heart because of the senses it interacts with and the technology that we use to experience it. So rarely does an art form use our hearing as its primary form of storytelling; with music, it is the <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">only</em> form of storytelling it uses. Not only that, but the technology of today demands privacy while listening to music. It is uncommon to see somebody walking down the street listening to their heavy beats through a boombox, or somebody sitting in an easy chair while a record spins scratchy rhythms through the air. Almost any casual listener uses earbuds for their portability and minimal style. Serious music fans use oversized earmuffs to keep their eardrums and the speakers close together, as if the sound they hear will decay over a few extra feet.</p><p name="fce5" id="fce5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">To me, using earbuds or headphones can help me keep my head together. Not in a “I’m slowly going crazy” sense, but I feel like it keeps my thoughts from leaking out of my ears while I work. As I’m writing, reading, or studying, using <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Bose-627476-0020-IE2-audio-headphones/dp/B003XU6H8I/ref=sr_1_1?s=audio-video-accessories&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1429390999&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=bose+ie2" data-href="http://www.amazon.com/Bose-627476-0020-IE2-audio-headphones/dp/B003XU6H8I/ref=sr_1_1?s=audio-video-accessories&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1429390999&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=bose+ie2" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">earbuds</a> helps me to focus on the task at hand. Music keeps pushing data into my head, so it keeps things from wiggling their way around my memory. It helps to shut out the outside world (which can be lonely at times), and on the contrary, it also gives people new ground to discuss when first getting to know one another. I don’t experience as much excitement as I do when I first show people new bands they’ve never heard of.</p><p name="4232" id="4232" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Another great part of music that other media can’t match is the intricacy and multi-layered texture of a song. Even in a few minutes, skilled artists can put together layer upon layer of instrumentation, rhythm, and lyrical poetry. Here is a fabulous example:</p><figure name="d443" id="d443" class="graf graf--figure graf--iframe graf-after--p"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Q-WM-x__BOk?feature=oembed" width="700" height="393" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></figure><p name="1f91" id="1f91" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">Although the music video is beautiful as well, try to keep that from distracting you from the delicate balance <a href="http://www.shugotokumaru.com/index_eng.html" data-href="http://www.shugotokumaru.com/index_eng.html" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Shugo Tokumaru</a> has put together. If you’re one of those people that doesn’t listen to music in other languages often, I suggest you try out a few more artists from around the world. Different ethnic and cultural backgrounds can result in an incredibly new and refreshing experience.</p><p name="87c9" id="87c9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Despite all of this, music can be shoved to the back burner when treated as an art form. If you continue reading my post, you will see that I often bring up music and sound in other media, which is a good example of how much I treasure it. It pairs incredibly well with a mixture of beautiful visuals and powerful story. I think that music is best on its own, but some of the most striking examples come from my own memories from video games and TV shows. It is unlikely that music can touch a listener as deeply as a combination of an emotional story told with incredible music in the background. I think that humans rely on sight more than hearing, and that is one reason why we have driven movies and TV to the foreground of entertainment.</p><p name="40ec" id="40ec" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Here is <a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/129765393" data-href="https://open.spotify.com/user/129765393" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">my Spotify profile</a>, feel free to take a listen to hear what I’m interested in.</p><p name="8e9d" id="8e9d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">TL;DR</strong></p><p name="647f" id="647f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Pros: listening is a powerful tool to influence a mindset; music is intricate and has lots of hidden value and meaning; engages hearing, a different sense than most others; putting headphones in keeps all my thoughts contained inside my head, I feel like I can think more clearly instead of having everything leak out;</p><p name="2866" id="2866" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Cons: Often used as background to other senses; can’t easily tell a story with music</p></div></div></section><section name="4197" class="section section--body"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><h3 name="1fd0" id="1fd0" data-align="center" class="graf graf--h3 graf--leading">Movies</h3></div><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--fullWidth"><figure name="9961" id="9961" class="graf graf--figure graf--layoutFillWidth graf-after--h3"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*8lKiSbWuh_B9SXPhClYfSw.jpeg" data-width="1122" data-height="440" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2560/1*8lKiSbWuh_B9SXPhClYfSw.jpeg"><figcaption class="imageCaption">I want to fight Uma Thurman but I would absolutely lose.</figcaption></figure></div><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><p name="6a36" id="6a36" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">In the past, I didn’t choose to treat movies with as critical an eye as I do now. As I have grown up, I have looked more analytically at the elements of a movie that I enjoy, and pieces that make a movie more favorable in every viewpoint. I wouldn’t be surprised if twelve-year-old me would have enjoyed movies like <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1320253/" data-href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1320253/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">The Expendables</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fast_and_the_Furious" data-href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fast_and_the_Furious" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Fast and Furious</a>, or <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0293662/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1" data-href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0293662/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">The Transporter</a>. These action movies appeal to a wide audience, and there’s really no question why. Firefights and fast camera cuts are suspenseful, intriguing, and adrenaline-pumping. Truly, I like few movies that lack those elements, but my taste has changed to crave emotional development and beautiful cinematography alongside brutal and dark violence.</p><p name="d832" id="d832" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Once I began watching Youtube channels like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/YourMovieSucksDOTorg" data-href="https://www.youtube.com/user/YourMovieSucksDOTorg" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">YourMovieSucks.org</a> (hilarious and lots of content) and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/everyframeapainting" data-href="https://www.youtube.com/user/everyframeapainting" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Every Frame a Painting</a> (high production value and interesting insight on cinematography), I started to question my idea of a good movie versus a bad movie. I will discuss animation with my TV show section next, but for this portion, I will be specifically directing my criticism toward live-action movies.</p><p name="0a70" id="0a70" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">First, I believe that all movies should incorporate a well-designed setting as much as they need a well-written script. I loved the setting and background of <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0266697/" data-href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0266697/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Kill Bill</a> and <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0378194/" data-href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0378194/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Kill Bill Vol. 2</a>, where it used retro Wild West tropes mixed with old school samurai cut-em-ups. I also love Lucy Liu, for reasons still unknown to me.</p></div><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--outsetColumn"><figure name="c2f7" id="c2f7" class="graf graf--figure graf--layoutOutsetCenter graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*d_qhcE-9WScjT6bRW3J_hA.jpeg" data-width="1024" data-height="768" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*d_qhcE-9WScjT6bRW3J_hA.jpeg"><figcaption class="imageCaption">Lucy Liu</figcaption></figure></div><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><p name="55d3" id="55d3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">Movies can use their bigger budgets to pay for enhanced visuals, props, and costumes. When a movie crew spends ample time creating a varied and interesting setting, I think it can help the viewer become more immersed in the story, which is critical to make a good movie.</p><p name="dd3f" id="dd3f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">As opposed to TV shows, movies can have a higher dollar-per-minute ratio, where they can spend more money per minute in order to pay highly rated actors, create realistic CGI effects, or construct beautiful sets. For example, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0944947/?ref_=nv_sr_1" data-href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0944947/?ref_=nv_sr_1" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Game of Thrones</a> spends about $60 million over the course of one season, or ten hours of content. In contrast, The Hunger Games spent $78 million for two and a half hours. That means Game of Thrones spends about $100,000 per minute during production, while The Hunger Games spent almost $550,000 per minute during production. This is one of many things that set movies apart from TV shows, and thus from other media as well.</p><p name="5c11" id="5c11" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Second, soundtracks play a key part in making a good movie even better. I wouldn’t say it’s my favorite movie of all time, but I enjoyed <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1091191/" data-href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1091191/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Lone Survivor</a>. The director employed <a href="http://www.explosionsinthesky.com/" data-href="http://www.explosionsinthesky.com/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Explosions in the Sky</a>, one of the best post-rock groups I’ve listened to, to create its soundtrack. A soundtrack may seem absent to most viewers, but music can deeply affect the emotions of people while watching a movie, in order to evolve a sad moment into a devastating one, or a turn a victory into the ultimate celebration. Sometimes, a lack of music can make a moment more surreal than one with music. I feel like the silent scenes in Saving Private Ryan are the fantastic. They contribute to the feeling of helplessness, fear, and destruction. Music for TV can often be pushed further into the background, although there are a few shows that have created a vast and visual soundtrack that boost the impact of the images onscreen. More on that later.</p><p name="6cdd" id="6cdd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The third and most obvious point is a cast of talented actors can affect the reception of a movie. I wanted to use a scene from Breaking Bad to exemplify Bryan Cranston’s skills at portraying devastation, but I will instead use this:</p><figure name="7fcb" id="7fcb" class="graf graf--figure graf--iframe graf-after--p"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OVf1FbVri-k?feature=oembed" width="700" height="393" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></figure><p name="2157" id="2157" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">Cranston is one of my favorite actors because of his combination of facial expressions, body language, and tone. He knows when to enunciate certain words, and how to move in a realistic manner to show the audience how his character feels. Actors like this are why I believe that movies and TV are as popular as they are compared to other media.</p><p name="7d89" id="7d89" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">As humans, we have complex systems inside our brain that can see another human, and act accordingly to their emotion. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirror_neuron" data-href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirror_neuron" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Mirror neurons</a>, the cells that create this reaction, fire when we see the face or body of another human, and we begin to create emotions similar to the emotions they express. This way, movies and TV can have a stronger emotional impact on the viewer, who sees another human on the screen and feels the same way they do.</p><p name="105f" id="105f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">On the contrary to TV, movies require less time investment and can still tell a fantastic story in a short period of time. A popular movie that exhibits this quality is <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2562232/" data-href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2562232/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Birdman: Or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)</a>. This movie did not need more time in order to tell its high caliber story. We, as viewers, get the whole package while watching this movie. Drama, character development, action (albeit a parody of it), and romance (sort of?). The slow but noticeable degradation of Riggan’s character and sanity is most prominent to me. I won’t spoil anything more, as it is still a fairly new movie. After this movie, I will be watching every one of Alejandro Iñárritu’s creations, as he has proved his skill and mastery of a craft with Birdman.</p><p name="2277" id="2277" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Although movies can create new universes for the audience in just a couple of hours, there is much they can miss, and the time constraint does not help. In order to stay faithful to a book, some movies will split the last movie in a series into two (although this probably is to drum up an even larger profit). The <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120737/" data-href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120737/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Lord of the Rings</a> series is known for its immense length in both written and cinematic form. This can be both to its detriment and benefit. I recently read the trilogy, and it took me almost a month to journey through the land of Middle Earth, despite my above-average reading speed. The movies themselves take anywhere from 9 to 11.5 hours, depending on which editions you watch. Even still, the movies cannot replicate every nuance and detail from every sentence Tolkien wrote, and that can be their downfall.</p><p name="db6e" id="db6e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">As with a lot of other media, movies also suffer from the inescapable linearity of storytelling. Less attentive or more distracted viewers can forget important lines that move the plot forward and characters that change over the course of time. Even the most attentive audience members often have to watch a movie or TV show twice in order to catch every detail. Movies sometimes create characters specifically to recount what happened in previous scenes, or use a heavy-handed flashback to remind us of a character’s past. This can create a starker contrast to see a character’s development, as development feels more realistic when it is gradual, but hard to notice unless the story reminds you.</p><p name="d4e3" id="d4e3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Despite its drawbacks, movies are easily digestible for the human mind, and demand less of our time than long-running TV shows. On-demand movies have helped increase their popularity as well. Because people can watch them from the comfort of their own homes after a long day at work, they have become more quenching to the human thirst for stories and entertainment.</p><p name="2509" id="2509" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">TL;DR</strong></p><p name="1600" id="1600" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Pros: often has a bigger budget for visuals; quick wrap-ups; swifter character development, moving images, powerful human emotions, mirror neurons, body language</p><p name="3fe5" id="3fe5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Cons: can be hard to fit a well-designed story into a short period of time, most pander to large audiences, linearity can affect interpretation</p></div></div></section><section name="db02" class="section section--body"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><h3 name="a55c" id="a55c" data-align="center" class="graf graf--h3 graf--leading">TV Shows</h3><p name="e337" id="e337" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">TV has quickly become my favorite way to experience stories, almost more so than a book. I believe TV shows will pave the way to new forms of storytelling in the future, as they have many perks compared to movies, and they are more pervasive in our technology-centered culture.</p><p name="2bd7" id="2bd7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I broke up live action (using human actors)and animated TV shows into two sections. Even though they have many similarities, they each trump one another in different areas.</p><h4 name="91ad" id="91ad" data-align="center" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Live Action</h4><figure name="637a" id="637a" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--h4"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*pRo0331BlExVR9SBmKDwLQ.jpeg" data-width="600" data-height="399" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*pRo0331BlExVR9SBmKDwLQ.jpeg"><figcaption class="imageCaption">Hannibal Lecter, as played by Mads Mikkelson</figcaption></figure><p name="bb8a" id="bb8a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">One of my favorite live action TV shows still on the air is <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2243973/" data-href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2243973/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Hannibal</a>. I have been watching five to six episodes a week (on demand) with my girlfriend, and it has held me captive for each and every chapter. At first, it seemed like another CSI or NCIS, where each episode the team is met with a new murder caused by a new serial killer, and they must catch him/her. However, the show is much deeper than that.</p><p name="67cb" id="67cb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Without spoiling more of the story, I think the character relationship between Dr. Hannibal Lecter and Will Graham is a complex and intricate web of manipulation and curiosity. I love the progression of Will’s character throughout the first season. When we reached episode 13 of the first season, both my girlfriend and I wondered how they would start season 2, as it seemed like it could have closed right there. My hesitation to watch season 2 came from a fear of the producers keeping a pet project alive too long, and I didn’t want to see the quality of the show decrease. I don’t think I could have been more wrong, as the character development continued its trek into untouched territories and the plot became even more suspenseful.</p><p name="754d" id="754d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This show is a great example of all of the things I love about TV. Fantastic plot direction, intriguing action/suspense, empathy toward characters, and unique and eclectic sound design. Out of those topics, I think that Hannibal is the most different from other TV shows by its sound design. As Will Graham descends into the mind of the murderers, the music shifts into rambunctious rattling marimbas, random bashing of drums, and the use of more “traditional” horror instruments, like a <a href="https://youtu.be/loIff_GHkjA?t=66" data-href="https://youtu.be/loIff_GHkjA?t=66" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">waterphone</a>. Those things are so creepy.</p><p name="943e" id="943e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Like Hannibal, all TV shows aren’t constrained by a short timeline, like a movie, and it is broken up into significant chunks, like chapters in a book. I feel like more and more shows are moving to an hour long time slot (45 minutes for those of you on Netflix or Amazon Prime), and I think that is the perfect length of time to keep my attention, but still end with a scene that makes me want to watch the next one.</p><p name="5bf4" id="5bf4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The writers can exploit these long periods of time (Hannibal currently has about 20 hours of content) to progress characters through an story arc designed to change them. Another great example, albeit more popular, is Game of Thrones. Characters over the course of the show can take 180 degree changes in personality, and they are completely justified by the experiences they have and trials they face. If the first book in the <a href="http://www.georgerrmartin.com/book-category/?cat=song-of-ice-and-fire" data-href="http://www.georgerrmartin.com/book-category/?cat=song-of-ice-and-fire" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Song of Ice and Fire</a> series, Game of Thrones, was filmed for theaters, they would have had to cut scenes and details from the book in order to fit it within only a couple of hours. This would fail to show what experiences forced the characters to break their old image and rebuild a new one.</p><p name="1b17" id="1b17" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">However, Game of Thrones suffers somewhat from a budget large enough to incorporate high-end CGI, but only for a few episodes per season. As I stated in the movie section, TV shows can get shafted when they have smaller dollar-per-minute ratios. The best part of Game of Thrones is that it (spoiler alert) has dragons in it.</p><figure name="fc67" id="fc67" class="graf graf--figure graf--layoutInsetLeft graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*-Pf7Jw4Ari0VbD4yesuZyA.jpeg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/400/1*-Pf7Jw4Ari0VbD4yesuZyA.jpeg"><figcaption class="imageCaption">(the other best part of Game of Thrones is Emilia Clarke)</figcaption></figure><p name="a4cb" id="a4cb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">Sadly, they can only show them a little bit per season, or else they don’t have enough money to pay for the talented actors and actresses on their set.</p><p name="3700" id="3700" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Like movies, experienced actors can really drive the feelings and emotions the writers try to push into the viewer’s heads. Scenes in books can fall short without this visual indication of how the reader should respond. Here’s an excerpt from Breaking Bad that shows how body language and speech really makes a scene more immersive and intense. Just wait for the laugh.</p><figure name="f6d1" id="f6d1" class="graf graf--figure graf--iframe graf-after--p"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cWfK5JyD2bA?feature=oembed&amp;start=14" width="700" height="393" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></figure><p name="cc6d" id="cc6d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">I remember watching this scene for the first time.

I am still young, and can justify my interest in more childish entertainment, as you’ll read about soon. Live action TV is able to be enjoyed by any age, and keeps the audience from feeling judged because they view it. Animated TV, on the other hand, can spark some <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">interesting</em> conversations when people like me bring it up to people who aren’t so keen on the idea of watching Cartoon Network at 18 years old.</p><h4 name="e8e2" id="e8e2" data-align="center" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Cartoons / Anime</h4></div><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--fullWidth"><figure name="08c8" id="08c8" class="graf graf--figure graf--layoutFillWidth graf-after--h4"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*aCfGGWeRqB7anB19mkPZ2Q.jpeg" data-width="1600" data-height="861" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2560/1*aCfGGWeRqB7anB19mkPZ2Q.jpeg"><figcaption class="imageCaption">Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann (Pierce the Heavens, Gurren Lagann) — A show with fantasic art direction, as you can see here.</figcaption></figure></div><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><p name="f40f" id="f40f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">Three of my favorite <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">American animated </strong>shows are <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1305826/" data-href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1305826/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Adventure Time</a>, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3061046/?ref_=nv_sr_1" data-href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3061046/?ref_=nv_sr_1" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steven Universe</a>, and <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0417299/?ref_=fn_al_tt_4" data-href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0417299/?ref_=fn_al_tt_4" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">The Last Airbender</a> / <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1695360/?ref_=nv_sr_1" data-href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1695360/?ref_=nv_sr_1" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">The Legend of Korra</a>.

These are all very fantasy-oriented shows, which incorporate a lot of things that live action TV shows or movies could never do. For example, this is a fight scene from the Legend of Korra (a second series based in The Last Airbender universe):</p><figure name="c1cb" id="c1cb" class="graf graf--figure graf--iframe graf-after--p"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zHlqmwI-Bd0?feature=oembed" width="700" height="393" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></figure><p name="1300" id="1300" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">In contrast, this is a fight scene from The Last Airbender <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">live action</strong> movie:</p><figure name="8622" id="8622" class="graf graf--figure graf--iframe graf-after--p"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_RpgbZcHk_A?feature=oembed" width="640" height="480" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></figure><p name="b7e1" id="b7e1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">Yeah… look at those rocks fly. So fast! So lifelike!</p><p name="2267" id="2267" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Anyway, the choreography and visuals in the first clip are unmatched by the second. I think there is simply a certain style of show that <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">must</strong> be created in an animated world, as opposed to live action. Stylized art can always accomplish better action scenes than in movies, as the animators don’t have to cut away every second in order to keep the scene seem real and fast-paced. Here’s another video showing off the beauty of animated fight scenes:</p><figure name="85a1" id="85a1" class="graf graf--figure graf--iframe graf-after--p"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RHRDEVe4XPE?start=111&amp;feature=oembed&amp;start=111" width="700" height="393" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></figure><p name="895d" id="895d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">This is the show Kill la Kill, that I mentioned earlier. The premise is that the woman in white took the other half of the girl in black’s scissor blade. They also have skimpy clothing that powers them up and makes them stronger. It’s a silly and terrific series that parodies a lot of the over-sexualized anime in circulation.</p><p name="0258" id="0258" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Those two shows truly exploit the limits of animated television, and use visuals and sound to show strength and ferocity in their fight scenes. Kill La Kill is Japanese in origin, and anime is extremely popular in their culture, even with people older than the age of 12. Clearly the costumes in this show were suited for a more “mature” and male-oriented audience.</p><p name="8574" id="8574" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The downfall of animation is the lack of human touch. Anime from Japan is stylized very similarly across shows. Large eyes, unruly hair, and a huge head on a lanky body is an image that makes up a lot of characters in anime, and that probably cuts some of the human empathy from the visual impact. Even with fight scenes that can be so much better, audiences may not feel the same way toward animation because it’s hard to relate with a 2D creature that doesn’t really look fully human.</p><p name="a7a6" id="a7a6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">However, I have noticed that music seems to take a seat closer to the head of the table in animated TV. This could be due to the fact that the feeling of a real human is taken away, and cartoons rely on a deeper soundtrack in order to convey emotions more accurately. I think a lot of people that watch cartoons are into video games as well, which is an art form that integrates music beautifully. I personally like animated television for this aspect, because a well-crafted soundtrack is important to me. An example is a scene from Steven Universe (I swear this is the last video clip for animated television). Steven is the boy in this scene, who was just eaten by a giant bird. Just listen to the music after Opal saves him:</p><figure name="c9f0" id="c9f0" class="graf graf--figure graf--iframe graf-after--p"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gzoe8OVLvrQ?feature=oembed&amp;start=83" width="700" height="393" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></figure><p name="57e5" id="57e5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">It’s like Final Fantasy, so freaking cool.</p><p name="a496" id="a496" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The visuals in this show are beautiful as well. I love the direction that they have gone with the art style.</p><p name="5112" id="5112" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">One of the main issues with animation is that it takes <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">forever</strong> to make, since it’s mostly handmade.

That definitely influences my ideas of musicals as well, but I don’t think going to more will suddenly make me change my mind.</p><p name="b1b5" id="b1b5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Plays are the oldest forms of entertainment on this list, as people telling stories in front of their friends and family started as early as spoken language. I like the fact that an art like this has been so influential for many more years than movies, TV, or video games.</p><p name="7687" id="7687" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">When I sit in a theater for a play, I feel a different way than I do when waiting in a theater for a movie. I feel more in touch with the actors and actresses on stage. I could yell random things and probably startle them. My behavior affects the entertainment I’m watching, which is novel to plays and concerts alone. That element of humanity makes a play stand out to me, which influences a lot more of the positive opinions I have about them.</p><p name="2cb2" id="2cb2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I enjoy plays for the fact that the actors deal with physical props. No CGI, no animatronics, nothing but humans and construction. It makes it seem less artificial, but effects to make a scene become surreal in a play often fall flat to me. Immersion is key for my enjoyment in entertainment.</p><p name="4673" id="4673" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In that same way, musicals are horrendous at keeping immersion throughout the whole performance. I may be invested in the story, but as soon as a group of teenagers breaks out into song and dance (see picture above), my illusion of the story is now broken. I don’t like watching things if I can’t forget about real life for the length of the entire show.</p><p name="1b4e" id="1b4e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I can’t find any funny videos to embed.</p><p name="3244" id="3244" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">TL;DR</strong></p><p name="6b3a" id="6b3a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Pros: human involvement is amazing; uses different elements that most other media doesn’t incorporate; has a different feeling sitting in a theater for it</p><p name="bc3e" id="bc3e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Cons: immersion sucks</p></div></div></section><section name="fb3d" class="section section--body"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><h3 name="c7fe" id="c7fe" data-align="center" class="graf graf--h3 graf--leading">Written Works</h3><figure name="e275" id="e275" class="graf graf--figure graf--layoutInsetLeft graf-after--h3"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*jzFe_cWj5HpXE9B2kUqFnA.jpeg" data-width="238" data-height="300" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/400/1*jzFe_cWj5HpXE9B2kUqFnA.jpeg"></figure><p name="a98a" id="a98a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">As you can probably tell from the length of this article, I’m pretty partial to writing.</p><p name="03a4" id="03a4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I just started reading a book called <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Shogun-James-Clavell/dp/0440178002" data-href="http://www.amazon.com/Shogun-James-Clavell/dp/0440178002" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Shogun</a> by James Clavell, and I love it. It’s a historical fiction based in feudal Japan, where a ship captain named Blackthorne finds himself captive on Japanese shores. I have only read a few chapters, but I have really enjoyed the structure of the writing and the setting in which it is written. I often find myself reading for hours, without thinking of getting up or moving around. My immersion in a book is very different compared to other media.</p><p name="0241" id="0241" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I think that the reason why I find myself unable to put a book down is because I’m in my own head, not watching a movie inside a small computer screen. While reading, the audience must construct the world inside their own mind, creating the visual data that is dictated to them. Because of this, our minds are most likely more active while reading a book, compared to watching TV or listening to music. The literature demands us to start thinking, or else we get lost and stop enjoying it.</p><p name="2860" id="2860" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The interpretations of every reader can affect how they feel about the characters in the story, and oftentimes I have found that movies and TV are more heavy-handed with their depiction of characters. Visual entertainment tries to make you feel a certain way about characters, while books can be much more subtle. These different interpretations drive the existence of hot-or-cold reviews of movies based on books. Readers find themselves either agreeing or disagreeing with a movie’s portrayal of a character, and that can break the entire story, even if the reader loved the novel it was based on.</p><p name="fc24" id="fc24" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">As a writer, I find myself observing the structure of the text and vocabulary more analytically. Because I am not a film director, I can do this better than I can critique choices for different camera shots in a movie. Joel B. Green wrote the first chapter in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Hearing-New-Testament-Strategies-Interpretation/dp/0802864201/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;sr=&amp;qid=" data-href="http://www.amazon.com/Hearing-New-Testament-Strategies-Interpretation/dp/0802864201/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;sr=&amp;qid=" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Hearing the New Testament</a> about the different ways of reading a text, and I found it very interesting.</p><p name="3973" id="3973" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Green states that <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">reading behind the text </strong>indicates that the reader is trying to find the deeper meaning behind the words, as if the book is simply a treasure chest, hiding its secrets inside. The text is the lock, barring shallow readers from finding the gems kept safely inside the chest. <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Reading the text</strong> looks at the presentation of the text, where the audience looks at the literal words on the page, and deciphers why the author wrote them the way that they did. <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Reading in front of the text</strong><em class="markup--em markup--p-em"> </em>actually thinks about the readers’ bias, and how they might interpret the book to mean different things based on their background, ethnicity, and culture. I wonder if the same person could interpret different ideas out of a book if they read it in their native language first, and again in a foreign language.</p><p name="7f3a" id="7f3a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The sheer age of the art of writing is also stunning. As far as I researched, I found the first written works to be crafted around the 24th and 23rd centuries BCE, by Egyptian writers. The fact that writing has been a part of human history for almost 4000 years is mindblowing to me. The creation of plays, storytelling, still art, and writing are ancient for modern humans. They are also the only forms of art that can be accessed without electricity or an Internet connection. Writing and the act of reading are inextricably meshed with human nature. However, with the rise of new media, we find ourselves losing interest in it.</p><p name="6dc2" id="6dc2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I think the reason why books seem to be less popular than movies and TV now is because they only engage one sense: sight. Even then, you can’t <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">see</em> the characters. Your mind must construct a reality in which the universe of the novel lives, and that can be difficult for some people. Without sound or body language to nudge the audience to feel a certain way, readers can feel unempathetic to characters. This might also be the reason why I haven’t found many books to be funny. There may be pockets of dry wit inside certain books, but oftentimes visual humor is hilarious compared to just a string of clever words.</p><p name="fcf6" id="fcf6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">TL;DR</strong></p><p name="b347" id="b347" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Pros: gives readers the ability to shape the world to their interpretation, I tend to focus a lot differently reading than in any other medium, the craftsmanship is a different thought process all together (reading the text)</p><p name="6ab8" id="6ab8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Cons: large time-investment, only engages one sense, comedy isn’t easily expressed in written form</p></div></div></section><section name="e4ac" class="section section--body"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><h3 name="8470" id="8470" data-align="center" class="graf graf--h3 graf--leading">Still Art</h3></div><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--fullWidth"><figure name="7abc" id="7abc" class="graf graf--figure graf--layoutFillWidth graf-after--h3"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*wKmKMi4Ik0Rp1g1ts3QcaQ.jpeg" data-width="1600" data-height="836" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2560/1*wKmKMi4Ik0Rp1g1ts3QcaQ.jpeg"><figcaption class="imageCaption">I like this version better than the original.</figcaption></figure></div><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><p name="c037" id="c037" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">I work at the Seattle Art Museum.

I think that still art is defined by any form of sculpture, painting, tapestry, or photograph that is unmoving, and is frozen in time. The difference between still art and the other forms I have discussed is that it is viewed with a single snapshot. People can take in all the visual data from the art in a single moment, although interpreting it can take time and you may miss details.</p><p name="a453" id="a453" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I love looking at sculptures, I think they are beautifully crafted, and it blows my mind to think about the time and care taken to create them.

It would take me years to become that good at carving. I think that statement is why still art isn’t appreciated as much as other forms of art.</p><p name="b899" id="b899" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">When I see a sculpture or painting, I look at it and say “Wow, what a great piece of art.” I then think about the effort or time spent making it. The Veiled Virgin is particularly spectacular because of the skill, but not special because of what it depicts. Yes, it is beautiful, but it is ordinary. I see women every day, and I can imagine what they would look like with a veil on their face. Most popular TV shows, movies, and books are interesting because they show things that I haven’t seen before. They show fiction, and I would wager to say that fiction has and will always sell better than non-fiction. Our ancestors didn’t tell stories about the one time they trapped a rabbit and ate it. They tell tales about the sea monsters in the ocean, and how they fought a bear and won! The human mind is much more fascinated in things unheard of.</p><p name="456d" id="456d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Even with paintings or illustrations of fantastical worlds, I find myself only looking so long at it. Because the visual data is a snapshot, I digest it quickly, and my mind wants to move on. I can’t speak for everybody, of course, but in my opinion the lack of linearity is both the greatest aspect and largest downfall of still art.</p><p name="a7ce" id="a7ce" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Without linearity, I can view everything in a painting at once. My eyes can’t interpret the meaning in a single instant, but I can always look at it again.

First, I see the six men pointing rifles at another man with his hands in the air. Second, I noticed that the cops are wearing gas masks, helmets, and look ready for a war. The man on the left side does not look ready for war, and that may be an indicator of the way they see the situation in Ferguson. The cops are on a completely different level than the residents of the city. The third and best part of this photo is the graffiti tagged on the mailbox, saying “Fuck the police.” This looks like a political cartoon from real life.</p><p name="010f" id="010f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">These kinds of images stand out to me because they are a single slice of time in the history of mankind. An infinitesimally small piece of our life can impact people and tell a story all on its own. It doesn’t need context, background, or awareness of the things going on around it. Despite the fact that every viewer sees the same picture, they can also glean different interpretations because of their background or personality.</p><p name="5820" id="5820" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">TL;DR</strong></p><p name="727b" id="727b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Pros: no linearity! audiences can see everything at once; the handiwork is often impressive and the technique is also part of the art itself; paintings are amazing because the artist must “trick” the audience into thinking a brushstroke is a tree or human; sometimes a single snapshot can show contrast better than linearity can</p><p name="d099" id="d099" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Cons: incredibly opinionated; an artistic style can be lost on viewers; lack of linearity tells nothing of development or time: art stays the same once it is finished, while life is linear</p></div></div></section><section name="cdb3" class="section section--body"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><h3 name="cead" id="cead" data-align="center" class="graf graf--h3 graf--leading">Video Games</h3></div><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--fullWidth"><figure name="82cd" id="82cd" class="graf graf--figure graf--layoutFillWidth graf-after--h3"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*FXg72xrY-gqFamDpIMm5pg.jpeg" data-width="1411" data-height="807" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2560/1*FXg72xrY-gqFamDpIMm5pg.jpeg"><figcaption class="imageCaption">My favorite game: Transistor by Supergiant Games</figcaption></figure></div><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><p name="8b6a" id="8b6a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">Now I am finally reaching the part of the article that spawned this whole idea.</p><p name="239d" id="239d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">As I was talking to one of my friends about a beautiful game called <a href="https://www.supergiantgames.com/games/transistor/" data-href="https://www.supergiantgames.com/games/transistor/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Transistor</a>, I thought about how many pieces of art are contained in a video game. Music, stylized art, and storytelling are key pieces that make up movies and TV shows, arguably the most popular art media today. Video games can take it one step further, as they add interaction into the mix.</p><p name="86be" id="86be" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><a href="http://stoicstudio.com/" data-href="http://stoicstudio.com/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">The Banner Saga</a> is a game that incorporates these main elements to their fullest extent. Take a look at this:</p><figure name="bf8b" id="bf8b" class="graf graf--figure graf--iframe graf-after--p"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mHaUw7LMjX0?feature=oembed&amp;start=15" width="700" height="393" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></figure><p name="599a" id="599a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">I haven’t finished The Banner Saga, but I fell in love with the art style within minutes of starting it. I think this video shows how truly stunning a game can be without having to be hyper-realistic. Games like <a href="http://www.elderscrolls.com/skyrim" data-href="http://www.elderscrolls.com/skyrim" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Skyrim</a> or <a href="http://crysis.com/" data-href="http://crysis.com/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Crysis</a> strive to have graphics that emulate our real world, even when adding fantasy or science fiction into the mix. Both The Elder Scrolls and Crysis series have been immensely popular, but I don’t consider them as future classics, because they aren’t anything truly new. Don’t get me wrong, I’ve played Skyrim over 400 hours and loved every second of it, but it’s not unique. It is simply just the best of its kind.</p><p name="ff6b" id="ff6b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Stylized games like <a href="http://fezgame.com/" data-href="http://fezgame.com/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">FEZ</a> or Transistor employ radical sound designers like <a href="http://disasterpeace.com/" data-href="http://disasterpeace.com/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Disasterpeace</a> and <a href="https://supergiantgames.bandcamp.com/" data-href="https://supergiantgames.bandcamp.com/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Darren Korb</a> to create rich and moving musical landscapes, in order to tack on another dimension to the addicting gameplay and lustrous art and graphics. Here is something for you to listen to while you read the rest of this section on video games.</p><figure name="bca5" id="bca5" class="graf graf--figure graf--iframe graf-after--p"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/41tIUr_ex3g?feature=oembed" width="700" height="393" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></figure><p name="4702" id="4702" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">As I thought about why video games keep me so immersed within their universe, I realized that it may also be due to the technology we use to experience them. When watching TV or a movie, your hands are either sitting in your lap, grabbing fistfuls of popcorn, or tapping away at your phone screen, and now you’re not paying attention to the art. Both books and video games occupy your hands, as you’re either holding paper in your hands or furiously typing and clicking at the same time. While I play video games, I also turn off my lights, and use headphones, keeping my precious attention on the screen. This can’t be said for all video games though, only consoles and PCs. What about mobile games?</p><p name="e1e8" id="e1e8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">My opinion of why <a href="https://www.angrybirds.com/" data-href="https://www.angrybirds.com/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Angry Birds</a> is so successful stems not from the main elements I listed above, but a more specific value that encompasses all of mobile gaming. The <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">game cycle</strong>, or how long a consumer must wait to feel rewarded by a game, is minimized to the smallest amount of time in mobile games. If we imagine that I just ordered my coffee, now I have two minutes to wait. Should I check on my email, or play just a level or two of Angry Birds? Angry Birds does not require the amount of time investment like console games such as Skyrim or Transistor. Not only that, but I’m constantly rewarded by the ruthless slaughter of little evil pigs. I feel good when I wipe that stupid smirk off their face. Games that shrink their game cycle to an utter minimum, while still maintaining fun and engaging gameplay, succeed to a ridiculous degree.</p><p name="cf59" id="cf59" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Due to this rampant success by Angry Birds and other hit mobile games, we now experience a new wave of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot-com_bubble" data-href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot-com_bubble" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Dot Com Boom</a>, where a huge amount of mobile games are simply a new visual experience on top of the same gameplay. This is also true for games like <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/" data-href="https://www.callofduty.com/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Call of Duty</a>, <a href="https://www.easports.com/fifa" data-href="https://www.easports.com/fifa" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">FIFA</a>, <a href="http://www.battlefield.com/" data-href="http://www.battlefield.com/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Battlefield</a>, and <a href="https://www.easports.com/madden-nfl" data-href="https://www.easports.com/madden-nfl" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Madden</a>, and unfortunately, <a href="http://www.pokemon.com/us/" data-href="http://www.pokemon.com/us/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Pokemon</a>. I’m a very big fan of Pokemon (don’t judge me) and it hurts to think about the executives at Nintendo just creating a new visual experience over the same gameplay.</p><p name="e745" id="e745" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The games that avoid this reuse of old gameplay elements tend to succeed, but in a different way than these long running franchises. However, even with similar gameplay elements, intense stories can keep the player interested over a series. I am a big fan of <a href="https://www.telltalegames.com/" data-href="https://www.telltalegames.com/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Telltale Games</a>, a game company that produces art reminiscent of point-and-click games, but with difficult choices and well-crafted story elements. Choosing your own path can deepen your immersion even more so than a book, movie, or TV show. Feeling as if you’re a part of the art yourself helps to hold interest in the game, and I enjoyed both of Telltale’s <a href="https://www.telltalegames.com/walkingdead/" data-href="https://www.telltalegames.com/walkingdead/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Walking Dead</a> titles for this reason.</p><p name="53a9" id="53a9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Due to this intense immersion and interaction, I feel like video games are my favorite way of experiencing art. With virtual reality a glimpse on the horizon, I hope that the video game industry can create new and innovative ways to tell stories. I’m looking forward to the video games I play when I’m retired, and hope they won’t replace the parts of my heart that are so dedicated to the classic games of today.</p><p name="f0f1" id="f0f1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">TL;DR</strong></p><p name="370f" id="370f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Pros: combination of all art, music plays a huge part in this, story plays a huge part in this, interaction plays an even larger part in this; linearity can often be used to express a starker contrast between characters, settings, or otherwise; immersion can be so much more powerful than with other media;</p><p name="e189" id="e189" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Cons: a balance between elements is very key; can sometimes spawn a lot of generic copies</p></div></div></section><section name="a2d8" class="section section--body section--last"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><h3 name="2893" id="2893" data-align="center" class="graf graf--h3 graf--leading">Conclusion</h3><p name="7d5a" id="7d5a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">I dare you to read the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art" data-href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Wikipedia page on art</a>. It is so vague, and so perfect in that way. Art isn’t so easily defined, as it can move and connect people across time and space. I like the caption that Wikipedia puts underneath this spectacular 12th-century painting by Wang Ximeng.</p></div><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--fullWidth"><figure name="ed30" id="ed30" class="graf graf--figure graf--layoutFillWidth graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*-Hj4jYPE1q_bRYUW4nFN6Q.jpeg" data-width="2500" data-height="534" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2560/1*-Hj4jYPE1q_bRYUW4nFN6Q.jpeg"><figcaption class="imageCaption">Thousand Li of Mountains and Rivers — Wang Ximeng</figcaption></figure></div><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><p name="e936" id="e936" data-align="center" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Works of art can tell stories or simply express an aesthetic truth or feeling.</em></p><p name="43cf" id="43cf" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Story-telling is my favorite portion of art. I want to learn more about the people around me, and experience as much as I can. That may be why I like to travel so much. Our experiences of the world around us, as well as the fading memories of them are the canvas; our brain interprets them due to all the other experiences we are aware of. This canon of information in our minds can be vastly different depending on where one is born, the parents that teach us, or the friends we interact with.</p><p name="dc68" id="dc68" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In order to fully understand how our brain “sees” things, I hope that someday we will be able to share and view each other’s dreamscapes. These visions while we sleep are perfect insights into that canon of information. It shows how our brains process events, and may be viewed as linear art like a movie. Dreams may also be seen as non-linear, a snapshot of a stunning world that nobody has ever imagined before.</p><p name="1909" id="1909" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">My goal is to create art, even through the most normal media. I want to program in a clean and creative way, to express myself through photographs and stories I tell. More importantly, I want to absorb all the art I can before I pass away; art created by either man or nature. Is there a greater beauty in this world other than the infinitely detailed creation of both Heaven and Earth?</p></div></div></section>
