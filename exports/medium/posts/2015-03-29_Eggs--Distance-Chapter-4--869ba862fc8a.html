Jolie pressed her hands against the walls, trying to increase the amount of air in her lungs with each rise and fall of her chest. The thin rod she held was on the ground already, but it had clattered against the metal as soon as Jolie had closed the door. She picked it up once again, the hangar more easily visible as her eyes grew more accustomed to the pitch black. Taking small and silent steps, she wandered away from the door, hoping that the insect was still struggling through the first. She wanted to cry and scream, the anxiety in her bones almost overwhelmed her. But she knew she wouldn’t, as the training she had been given was still ingrained even more deeply in her DNA. A quick, deep breath, and she was Jolie again. How long ago that training seemed now.</p><p name="fdc8" id="fdc8" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Leif?” Jolie hissed, her voice cutting through the still air inside the room. Nothing but an empty echo replied. He had died already, or he left her to be killed by the monsters. She was nothing more than a simple distraction… it was finally coming together. Jolie shook her head in disbelief. How could she not have seen it? He had come here to find landmarks, which means he was looking for her ship, most likely. Leif wasn’t expecting to find survivors, he just wanted their solution. Her hands clenched into fists now, she almost stomped through the ship into the next hallway. Even in the dark, she knew he would go to the bridge. There was a safe place there, away from those monsters. He could contact whoever hired him, and wait it out until they showed up. Jolie was seething now, and vowed to not let that happen. She was going to kill Leif. Fortunately, she knew just the way to do it.</p><p name="c913" id="c913" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Jolie strode immediately to the corridor to her left. The sliding door was jammed by a crate wedged haphazardly between the frame and the door itself. She clambered over it hastily, trying to make her way toward the bridge. She would have more room to move about in there, and to watch her back, if she were to be ambushed by Leif or the creatures. The lack of light was bothering her eyes already, as she was beginning to see small shadows skitter out of sight when she got near. Jolie had to stop briefly to compose herself. They were just rats, just rats. She moved on.</p><p name="ddfb" id="ddfb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The bridge was a straight shot, but the crash had damaged the inside more than the hull outside had given away. Jolie had to make her way through hundreds of overturned containers, strewn about the various cargo bays. As she neared the bridge, it was easier to move about, but the hallways were tight. If one was blocked or closed, she had to detour through many more to make her way around the wreckage, putting her at more of a risk of being discovered.</p><p name="3b2c" id="3b2c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Through her training, Jolie had learned many techniques on how to be stealthy and methodical. When suspecting an ambush, she needed to check every corner of every room, which also helped the scavenger hunt for supplies. Jolie was able to pick up a few objects for weapons and tie them loosely into the belt around her cargo pants, ready to use at a moment’s notice. A meat tenderizer, a heavy plumbing wrench, and a sharp triangle of metal all sat dormant within her reach. She was nearly at the bridge, and she hoped that Leif was waiting for her, so she could rip out his throat without a second of remorse, in a hot blooded fury that didn’t require her to think.</p><p name="8e6f" id="8e6f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Leif shivered. He knew that Jolie was waiting for him, and didn’t want to move from the secure spot. He had found a small hole underneath a stack of crates that had toppled over into another room. He had wedged a piece of sheared metal underneath a box on top to peer out, watching the room in case Jolie was planning on sneaking in. The glass dome directly opposite him was mesmerizing, the stars in the sky barely visible at the top. Even still, Leif couldn’t stop staring at it. He checked the room again, looking for Jolie, his stalker, his hunter. He had been the prey often, but never with another human. Leif did not feel pride at his ability to hide, but he did not feel ashamed because of it either. He knew that hiding may be the best option now, and used that to his advantage. If she came close to him, he had found a dull fire axe that he could… kill her with. It seemed too primal for Jolie to die by its hand. He didn’t care.</p><p name="ab48" id="ab48" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">As if the story of his life was moving into the final act, the main supporting actor stepped out. Jolie entered stage left. She moved, and now she was in center view. She looked in his direction, could she see him?</p><blockquote name="701f" id="701f" class="graf graf--pullquote graf-after--p">Thump.</blockquote><p name="d671" id="d671" class="graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote">Leif and Jolie both turned toward the window. A humanoid frame had pressed himself against the dome, arms and legs meekly sliding in irregular patterns. The man, dressed like Jolie, was banging at the glass as if he wanted to get in, but Leif couldn’t see his mouth moving. He seemed to be unconscious while he moved, his eyes receiving no light anymore. Jolie’s hand covered her mouth, in almost comical fright, but Leif could read her body even while still hidden so many meters away. She knew the man. A clatter of segmented legs and exoskeleton plating scraping against each other, and Leif’s hand fell from the fire axe on the ground. It didn’t matter now. The creatures were here, their devilish tricks and dances prepared over centuries, for a moment just like this. A shrill voice screamed in Leif’s head, and he watched Jolie cringe at the same sound.</p><blockquote name="e8d3" id="e8d3" class="graf graf--pullquote graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--pullquote-em">YOU ARE THE PUPPETS, AND WE PULL THE STRINGS</em></blockquote><p name="c3a3" id="c3a3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote">They had been following him.</p><p name="d912" id="d912" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">They were playing with him.</p><p name="adfc" id="adfc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Leif was a toy.</p><p name="e5ff" id="e5ff" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Jolie was a marionette.</p><p name="190e" id="190e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">She was not in control.</p><p name="03dd" id="03dd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">She was a game to them, the puppeteers.</p><p name="bd45" id="bd45" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">With another thump, a second crew member slumped against the glass. Jolie shrieked. The puppeteers had their tools attached now, and they used their techniques to terrify her. More wraith-like bodies slammed against the window, their arms and legs banging against the obstruction. Men. Women. Children. All of them. Dead. By Jolie’s hand? That’s what they wanted her to think. That’s what the puppeteers did, they get in your head, and that’s all you can think. Fear, darkness, repulsion, sickening terror, pounding in your heart, enveloping your skin and bones and chest, covering your eyes, making you think it’s all real. You know it’s all real, don’t you?</p><p name="0c28" id="0c28" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Leif pulled the boxes away from his hiding spot. Ten or more bodies were pounding against the glass, their fists and legs controlled as if they were dolls in a voodoo dance. Leif looked more keenly at the bodies as he moved to shield Jolie. He could see the feelers of the insects, almost invisible in the darkness. They were pressed… no, inserted into the joints of each body. There was more than just one puppeteer, each one using the bodies of Jolie’s comrades to terrify her. Leif covered the distance between them quickly, and crouched beside her. She was on the ground now, the whites of her eyes and her skin almost the same color, the blood rushing from her face. She could scream no more, only writhe from the shock and pain. Tears streaked down her face, she couldn’t see Leif anymore. Leif noticed her belt full of weapons, but crouched in front of her, blocking her from the view of the massacre. These were her crewmates, her friends. The blank eyes bled slightly on the cheeks of the victims, their gaunt skin stretched tight over dead faces. Leif fought the urge to vomit. The frightening cruelty of these animals was even more terrifying as he realized the intelligence behind the movements. They began to break through the glass methodically, precisely. Only when the first shards of glass began to clatter to the ground did Leif hear the noises outside. He looked at Jolie. She was unconscious. He bent down and held her, pressing her body between him and the floor, determined to keep these creatures off of them. The noises became louder, and Leif understood the purpose.</p><p name="50c1" id="50c1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">A wail of delight resounded from the plain outside, and echoed through the bridge, clashing with the sounds of shattering glass. A chittering had begun through the walls, more puppeteers joining the rest. They had apparently been lying in wait for the perfect moment to strike. Leif heard their legs pounding on the metal behind him, sprinting toward his body and Jolie’s. He held her even more tightly against him, as he began to feel the cold points of their arms poking against and through his suit. He took a deep breath, gulping the last bits of oxygen he would be able to manage, as his suit was not going to be able to hold anymore once it was punctured. He let go of Jolie at once, her belt coming off and sliding into his hands. He unsheathed a dagger, a sheet of triangular metal that Jolie had found. Fueled by fear, rage, and disgust, he spun and jumped at the insect nearest to him. Jamming the tip into the chink in its armor under the jaw, he twisted the metal and gritted his teeth. A squeal and scream erupted from those mandibles, the teeth snapping and roaring in his face. The mask protected him from that predatory grasp, and the motions of the puppeteer slowed to a stop. Leif, struggling to not gasp for air, moved quickly to look behind him, expecting to see another creature leaping up to kill him.</p><p name="35d8" id="35d8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Instead, what he saw was one creature’s feeble feelers thrusting themselves into the abdomen of another, those purple sockets growing larger and turning white. Both creatures seemed in a trance, their bodies clenched. They were synced with this abhorrent dance, of monstrous love and pleasure. Leif, in stunned silence, only now noticed the rest of these insects a part of this repulsive orgy feeding on his fear. An anger filled his chest, threatening to burst out and kill each of these disgusting animals in a way as cruel as their own.</p><p name="4907" id="4907" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Instead, Leif rushed to Jolie’s side, her eyes still empty of consciousness, as blank as the ones of the corpses forgotten outside. The frenetic motions of the creatures around him made Leif pull her more swiftly to his previous hiding spot. Screams and shrieks struck his ears like knives, as if the blade was twisting in his abdomen. As Leif collapsed to a heap under the unruly stack of boxes, his final breath inhaled the smell of a fresh alien conception.</p></div></div></section>
