As a grimace slashed across his mouth, Leif fell backward, smashing his tailbone onto the new planet. He jumped up quickly, checking for any leaks in the suit. Leif wasn’t thankful for the low levels of comfort inside the Alien Exploration Mark Six, but it was the most durable exploration gear on the market. He lifted himself up with the least bit of effort, and began to scan the horizon for landmarks or potentially dangerous wildlife. He saw nothing, and started to brush the dust off of his suit. The Alien Exploration Mark Six was high-end, coated in heat-resistant and waterproof synthetic materials. It was a light and creamy gray that blended well with most dark settings where predators tended to lurk. Leif scoured the distance once again, and once satisfied with his idea of the landscape, he began to walk toward the tree line he had noticed previously. He judged that it would take him only an hour to reach it.</p><p name="5388" id="5388" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">He reached the forest, a gloomy looking grove that didn’t offer much visibility of the surroundings. Leif hoped he might be able to see some rare wildlife; typically the most dangerous and intelligent animals lived in dense areas with more places to hide. He put his thickly gloved hand up against the bark of a nearby tree, feeling the rough skin of an unknown lifeform through the unique sensors in his outfit. He tapped the side of his helmet, activating the computer system inside the exploration suit.</p><p name="215a" id="215a" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Any movement detected?” Leif wondered what he would see if the answer was yes.</p><p name="c139" id="c139" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Negative.”</p><blockquote name="e034" id="e034" data-align="center" class="graf graf--pullquote graf-after--p">Click.</blockquote><p name="3ea8" id="3ea8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote">The sound, ominous in nature, reverberated through Leif’s speakers in his helmet.</p><p name="0fe3" id="0fe3" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Where did that come from?” He asked the computer. The exploration suit measured his pulse to be slightly faster, although Leif himself was not conscious of the change.</p><p name="f6c7" id="f6c7" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Straight ahead, an unknown distance.” The computer replied, its artificial voice giving Leif no comfort. He stepped forward confidently, hoping to find the source of the sound in the next few strides.</p><p name="77e0" id="77e0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">That was clearly not the case, as he had begun walking over an hour ago, and had found neither the source of the noise nor an exit to the increasingly dense forest. As the trees grew closer and closer together, Leif’s mind grew more and more set on the idea of turning back the way he came.</p><p name="0625" id="0625" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“How long are the days here?” He asked.</p><p name="9c73" id="9c73" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“24 hours of light, 24 hours of darkness.” The computer replied. Leif nodded his head to nobody in particular. He opened his mouth to ask another question, before being interrupted by two alien clicks, sounding like they were only a short distance ahead of him. Leif lunged forward, trying to find the source of the sound.</p><p name="ad1a" id="ad1a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">After sprinting, slowing to a jog, and then walking once again, Leif had still made no progress in locating the origin of the clicking. The lush trees were becoming more green, their branches extending more greedily toward the sunlight above them. The ground was more springy than it was near the edges of the forest, the bed of moss growing more thickly near here. As Leif stood and looked up, he noticed the sky was darkening, and he had hoped to be back to his zeppelin by sundown. Only a few more hours to go, and he had already wandered too far. Should he continue forward, or find shelter in his balloon? Before his mind had time to procure an answer, a rattling of teeth by his ear made him startle and turn rapidly. Nothing nearby seemed to have made the noise, but as his eyes focused more clearly, he saw a tiny spring, alive and bubbling in the middle of a forest. Its spray was light and frothy, the droplets clinging to delicate flower buds. An even more delicate body laid next to the spring, and Leif was at her side before he realized he was moving. The rattling sound had completely passed from his memory.</p><p name="a836" id="a836" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Leif pressed his gloved hand up to the neck of the woman on the ground, and felt a feeble pulse. He kneeled, and slipped one arm under her knees and another in between her arms and chest, to carry her easily back to the zeppelin for further rehab. She stirred briefly, shocking green eyes piercing into Leif’s helmet. Her eyelids fluttered shut again, and Leif assumed she was unconscious. How could a woman survive without a suit on this planet? The atmosphere was not fit for a human. He lumbered away, trying to move as fast as possible. As the spring disappeared into the distance, a light mist began to weave through the trees, obscuring Leif’s vision partially. The forest was now growing noticeably dark, and he worried about not reaching the zeppelin before the sun went down completely.</p><p name="3ad3" id="3ad3" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Does she need emergency medical help?” Leif asked the computer. It was able to diagnose her through the nerve endings inside Leif’s gloves.</p><p name="26f2" id="26f2" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Negative. She is only unconscious, most likely from hunger or thirst.” Leif, now struggling to move at a quick pace, stopped and began to search the area for shelter. The stygian mist grew thicker, swirling gently around him. He walked forward only a few more steps, and to his great relief, a massive structure loomed above him. Was it man-made? He couldn’t tell from here, but he was already picking up the woman and moving toward it.</p><blockquote name="17ec" id="17ec" class="graf graf--pullquote graf-after--p">Click.</blockquote><p name="7c19" id="7c19" class="graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote">Leif started looking wildly around him, before grumbling in irritated confusion. The voice in his helmet stayed quiet this time, apparently having no data to report. Leif ignored it once again, to his detriment. As he neared the temporary shelter, he squinted, and saw that it was a derelict starship. The metal beast was pressed against the base of a hill. Its body was shaped for aerodynamics, so he knew that it was used primarily for landing and exploring foreign planets. Two chamfered tetrahedrons pointed out symmetrically from the front, and nestled in between was the center of command. The bridge was marked by a giant domed window, pointed out toward an empty plain of grass and other earth-colored plants. No wildlife could be seen around the area, and the hull was strangely untouched. A trench was dug behind the ship, as if it had recently crash landed on this planet, but no damage was seen on the surface of the ship.</p><p name="28d3" id="28d3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Leif felt movement in his arms, and as he looked down, a fist flew up and punched his helmet with the force of a jackhammer. His mind flickered around the ways he could catch himself and still manage to hold the woman, but it was too late. In his suit, he twisted to land on his side, and with an awkward roll, he was able to get himself back on his feet. As he regained his focus, the woman was in a hybrid stance, not sure if she should run or confront her captor. Leif had not realized the power in the girl when she was by the spring, but now he noticed her surprisingly broad shouldered torso, paired with a lean stature. Her biceps were bulging underneath her ratty white tank top, but appeared to be carefully crafted as to not be too large, in order to maintain her agility. Leif stood at the ready, his frame hidden well underneath the baggy folds of his terranaut suit. His ability was underestimated, but also restricted by the stiffness of his equipment. She wore cargo pants and flexible running shoes, which put her at a distinct advantage. Both him and the woman decided simultaneously that they could not flee, but Leif did not strike first. With a quiet grunt, she released a solid right hook at his helmet. He reached to block, and with his other hand, grabbed around her waist and threw her off balance. She hit the ground flat on her back, and Leif heard the air rush out of her lungs. He collapsed on top of her and held her against the ground. She squirmed, punching and kicking his back and legs. A punch connected with his helmet again, but Leif continued to hold her down, trying to force her to surrender.</p><p name="2af7" id="2af7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Somehow, she slipped out from his grasp and through his legs, before stepping backward, putting distance between them. As Leif got on his feet, they were both frozen by a frenzied clicking, just like what Leif had heard when he came across the spring where he found the woman. Her eyes were wide now, obviously trying to track movement in the trees behind Leif. They were in an empty pasture, just on the edge of the forest, and Leif turned just in time to see a terrible insectoid form scuttle deeper into the woods. A gasp came from the woman’s mouth, and she paused briefly before speaking.</p><p name="5ecf" id="5ecf" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p graf--trailing">“…I think it was watching us.” The woman’s fighting position wavered and fell as her body began to tremble violently with fear.</p></div></div></section>
