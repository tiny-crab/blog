Reeking bodies were piled everywhere inside, certainly a fire hazard, although it didn’t matter if one broke out and turned the jail into a pile of ashes. There were only dead men in here, although they wailed and screamed and hungered as if they weren’t. Leif was one of them now, and his child-like bones cried in opposition to this new setting. He wasn’t ready.</p><p name="16eb" id="16eb" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“You must been one of them colonials, huh?” the man hissed in Leif’s direction. Leif didn’t reply, only stared back with an unblinking gaze. That intense look of his was already becoming a habit. “I’m Thoreau, who’re you?” Leif opened his mouth to speak, and only a hoarse whisper came out. He touched his throat with his hand, feeling the damage from his capture. There must have been more punishment after he fell unconscious. Thoreau reached forward in a paternal motion, but the child didn’t move in response. He sat there, his stormy grey eyes searching through his memories, blind to his surroundings for now. Thoreau leaned back against the dank concrete, and ran his fingers through his thick beard. Tiny pebbles were scattered in the corner near Leif. He rolled a small one in between his forefinger and thumb, before dropping it back to the floor, where it belonged. Leif cleared his throat, and his body transformed it into a racking cough, burning his esophagus and lungs. He turned again toward Thoreau, who still sat twirling the fringes of his beard. His mottled eyes were scanning over Leif analytically.</p><p name="0359" id="0359" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Leif,” the boy said, his throat straining to push the air out of his mouth. Thoreau nodded, his fingers ceasing to move but his hand still hovering by his beard.</p><p name="861e" id="861e" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“I’m sorry for you, kid. You’ve a tough road ahead. How’d ya get captured?” Thoreau’s voice and slang was straight out of the old Earth movies that Leif watched with his family. And Daniel.</p><p name="d5cf" id="d5cf" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“I… don’t know.” Leif’s face began to shift back into a gloomy, <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">why me</em> look. Self-pity was one thing that all the men had in common in here. Thoreau was chased by it like a convict chased by a bloodhound.</p><p name="9dd7" id="9dd7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">A loud clanging at the bars of the cell startled Leif. Thoreau continued to look at his face for a moment longer, then turned toward the noise. The strongest men started to shove their way toward the front, pushing the broken, living bodies out of the way and into the piles of the broken, dead ones. Leif, a child, would end up getting as much food as Thoreau, an old man. Leif struggled to his feet, and pushed himself to an invisible line behind the men in front.</p><p name="d734" id="d734" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Flecks of water sprayed over the tops of the men, and Leif caught a glance of a massive fire hose spraying a steady stream of water. It cascaded through the cell, coating the piles of bodies near the front corners. A wall of prisoners blocked it from rinsing the ones farther away. An easy way to bathe, but uncomfortable when many drenched men sat in a cell together. There was mold in the creases on the ceiling, over the tiles in the front. The slippery mildew coated the feet of those pressed toward the front, nearest to the food and bathing water.</p><p name="dbc4" id="dbc4" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Don’t strain yerself, kid. Just wait.” Leif turned toward Thoreau, behind him now. The drops of water trickled down his back, cold and dirty. Thoreau’s back was hunched from his years, and his eyes looked directly into Leif’s. “It’s not worth trying.”</p><p name="416c" id="416c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">His small fists clenched as tightly as his jaw, he nodded with understanding. He slumped down next to his pebbly friends in the corner, tears pulling the dirt off his cheeks in two distinct trails.</p></div></div></section><section name="6d10" class="section section--body section--last"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><p name="e0de" id="e0de" class="graf graf--p graf--leading">Colonists always had dreams. Leif woke nearly every night, his eyes darting around the familiarity of his room, searching for a cue or sign to anchor him to the true reality. Seven thousand, four hundred and nine days of consecutive nights with this passionate hunt. He already started counting from zero again.</p><p name="6563" id="6563" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Thoreau was awake already, rolling small clumps of his beard in between his fingers again. His legs fidgeted, shifting as if to find a comfortable position. His eyes, full of small white cataracts, swept from side to side like radar, taking note of the people around him. Leif lifted a hand to touch his own eyes briefly, but set it gently back down into his lap. Leif looked at Thoreau for a while, anchored again. His eyes began to close again, the anchor slowly being reeled up inside the recesses of his mind.</p><p name="e067" id="e067" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">As Leif fell back asleep, Thoreau turned back to watch him again. The child’s small chest rose and fell in time with his ragged breaths. Dark purple bruises were splotched across his ribcage and neck, the loose blood pooling in ever larger puddles. Thoreau turned over his hand, his eyes moving over the distinct wrinkles and lines in his skin, barely covering the gaunt skeleton underneath. He felt a soft hand brush against his leg.</p><p name="b226" id="b226" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“It’s been a while.” He greeted the woman with a strained smile. She smiled back at him, her lips closed. The woman pulled his head into her lap, lightly stroking the few remaining hairs on his head. Thoreau closed his eyes, his body relaxing in her presence. She pressed her lips to his forehead, and then nuzzled her face against his.</p><p name="2e10" id="2e10" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“You haven’t forgotten me, have you?” she said.</p><p name="5be3" id="5be3" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Never.”</p><p name="9a36" id="9a36" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“It’s time for you to join me. It is time for you to be with your family.”</p><p name="207b" id="207b" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p graf--trailing">“You wound me. Not yet. Just… a little while longer.”</p></div></div></section>
